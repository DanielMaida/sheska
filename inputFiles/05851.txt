Abstract
Image is usually taken for expressing some kinds of emo-
tions or purposes, such as love, celebrating Christmas.
There is another better way that combines the image and
relevant song to amplify the expression, which has drawn
much attention in the social network recently. Hence, the
automatic selection of songs should be expected. In this pa-
per, we propose to retrieve semantic relevant songs just by
an image query, which is named as the image2song prob-
lem. Motivated by the requirements of establishing corre-
lation in semantic/content, we build a semantic-based song
retrieval framework, which learns the correlation between
image content and lyric words. This model uses a convo-
lutional neural network to generate rich tags from image
regions, a recurrent neural network to model lyric, and then
establishes correlation via a multi-layer perceptron. To re-
duce the content gap between image and lyric, we propose
to make the lyric modeling focus on the main image content
via a tag attention. We collect a dataset from the social-
sharing multimodal data to study the proposed problem,
which consists of (image, music clip, lyric) triplets. We
demonstrate that our proposed model shows noticeable re-
sults in the image2song retrieval task and provides suitable
songs. Besides, the song2image task is also performed.
1. Introduction
Images are usually taken for the purpose of memoriz-
ing, which could contain some specific contents and convey
some kinds of emotions. For example, when celebrating
the Christmas day, the captured pictures commonly contain
dressed up people and Christmas trees covered with gifts,
which is used to remember the happiness time. However,
images appear to exist in only visual modality, which could
be weak in expressing the above purpose. Inspired by vi-
sual music and musical vision [22], we consider that the
object: tree, flower, ball, dress, stock…
attribute: smiling, green, happy, red…

There are several words (in different color) appearing in both im-
age tags and lyric words. Best viewed in color.
stimulates come from different senses (e.g. vision, audi-
tory, tactile) may share similar performance. Hence, if the
captured image is combined with a relevant song that ex-
presses similar purpose, the expression will be obviously
enhanced, which results from the more useful merged infor-
mation from multimodal data [40, 23]. For example, show-
ing the Christmas image while playing the song Jingle Bells
is easier to touch viewers than single image. Hence, this
kind of combination has attracted much attention in nowa-
days, which is simpler than video but richer than photo. But
existing approaches of song selection for a given image are
almost based on manual manner. Such methods often cost
users a lot of time to decide but could still suffer from the
small song library of users and lack of song comprehen-
sion. Hence, the technique of automatic image-based song
recommendation should be expected, which is named as im-
age2song in this paper.
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a traditional re-
search field, which focuses on indexing proper music ac-
cording to specific criteria. In this paper, the proposed im-
age2song retrieval task aims to find the semantic-related
songs for images, which therefore relies on the specific
image content analysis. Hence, this task belongs to the
semantic/tag-based music retrieval category [32]. Such re-
trieval tasks utilize multiple textual data sources as the mu-
sic modality for meeting the semantic requirements, such
as music blog in SerachSounds [3, 38] and web pages
in Gedoodle [19]. In this paper, we focus on retrieving
songs (not instrumental music) for images, which contain
sufficient textual data in lyric. More importantly, these tex-
tual data contains multiple common words in image tags (as
shown in Fig. 1), which are considered as the related content
across the modalities. Hence, lyric is adopted as the textual
data source for retrieval. However, there still remains an-
other two problems. First, image and lyric are different,
where the former is non-temporal and the latter is temporal-
based. More importantly, lyrics are not specifically created
for images, which results in the content description gap be-
tween them [32]. Second, there is barely dataset providing
corresponding images and songs, which makes it difficult to
learn the correlation via a data-driven fashion.
In this paper, to overcome the above problems, our con-
tributions are threefold:
• We leverage the lyric as the textual data modality for
semantic-based song retrieval task, which provides an
effective way to establish the correlation between im-
age and song in semantic.
• We develop a multimodal model based on neural net-
work, which learns the latent correspondence by em-
bedding the image and lyric representations into a
common space. To reduce the content gap, we intro-
duce a tag attention approach that makes the bidirec-
tional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) of lyric focus
on the main content of image regions, especially for
the related lyric words.
• We build a dataset that consists of (image, music clip,
lyric) triplets, which are collected from the social-
sharing multimodal data on the Internet1.
Experimental results verify that our model can provide no-
ticeable retrieval results. In addition, we also perform the
song2image task and our model has an improvement over
state-of-the-art method in this task.
2. Related Work
Image description. An explicit and sufficient description
of image is necessary for establishing the correlation with
lyric in content. There have been many attempts over the
years to provide detailed and high level description of im-
ages effectively and efficiently. Sivic and Zisserman [36]
represented the image by integrating the low-level visual
features into bag-of-visual-words, which has been widely
applied in the scene classification [21] and object recog-
nition [35]. Recently, in view of the advantages of Con-
volutional Neural Network (CNN) in producing high-level
1The dataset is available at https://dtaoo.github.io/
semantic representation, many approaches based on it have
shown great success in image understanding and descrip-
tion [31, 25]. However, these methods just focus on describ-
ing the image in specific fixed labels, while our work aims
at providing a richer description of images, which points
out the detailed image contents. Wu et al. [46] proposed
an attribute predictor with the same purpose, which viewed
the prediction as a multi-label regression task but without
focusing on the image contents in specific regions.
Lyric modeling. A number of approaches have been pro-
posed to extract the semantic information of lyrics. Most of
these works viewed lyric as a kind of text, therefore Bag-
of-Words (BoW) approach was usually used to describe the
lyrics [4, 13, 16], which accounted for the frequency of
word across the corpus, e.g. Term Frequency-Inverse Docu-
ment Frequency (TF-IDF) [44]. However, almost all these
works aimed at emotion recognition [16] or sentiment clas-
sification [47]. Recently, Schwarz et al. [33] proposed to
embed the lyric words into vector space and extract relevant
semantic representation. But, this work just focused on sen-
tences rather than the whole lyric. What is more, Schwarz et
al. [33] just performed pooling operation over the sentence
words, which ignored to model the contextual information
of lyric. Compared with the previous works, our work fo-
cuses on the lyric content analysis for providing sufficient
information to learn the correlation with image, which takes
consideration of both the semantic and context information
of words.
Multimodal learning across image and text. Several
works have studied the problem of annotating image with
text. Srivastava and Salakhutdinov [39] proposed to use
Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine (MDBM) to jointly
model the images and corresponding tags, which could be
used to infer the missing text (tags) from image queries, or
inverse. Sohn et al. [37] and Hu et al. [12] extended such
framework to explore and enhance the similarity across im-
age and text. Recently, amounts of works focused on using
natural language to annotate image instead of tags, which is
usually named as image caption. These works [17, 18, 26]
commonly utilized deep CNN and RNN to encode the im-
age and corresponding sentences into a common embedding
space, respectively. The aforementioned works aimed to
generate relevant tags or sentences to describe the content of
images. In contrast, our work focuses on learning to max-
imize the correlation between image and lyric, where the
lyric is not specially generated for describing the concrete
image content but a text containing several related words.
Music visualization. Music visualization has an opposite
goal of our work, which aims at generating imagery to de-
pict the music characteristic. Yoshii and Goto [50] pro-
posed to transform musical pieces into a color and gradation
visual effects, i.e., a visual thumbnail image. Differently,
Miyazaki and Matsuda [28] utilized a moving icon to visu-
alize the music. However, these methods are weak in con-
veying semantic information in music, such as content and
emotion. A possible way to deal with such defects is to learn
the semantic from lyrics and establish correlation with real
images. Cai et al. [2] manually extracted the salient-words
from lyrics, e.g. location and non phrases, then took them as
the key words to retrieve images. Similar frameworks could
be found in [45, 49], while Schwarz et al. [33] focused on
the sentences of lyrics and organized the retrieved images
of each sentence into a video. In addition, Chu et al. [5]
attempted to sing the generated description of an image for
the first time, but it was too limited for various music style
and lack of natural melody. In contrast to these methods
which are based on rough tag description [2, 45, 49, 33]
and direct similarity measure between features of different
modalities [33], we propose a multimodal learning frame-
work to jointly learn the correlation between lyric and im-
age in a straightforward way while analyzing the specific
content for both of them.
3. The Shuttersong Dataset
In order to explore the correlation between image and
song (lyric), we collect a dataset that contains amounts of
pairwise images and songs from the Shuttersong applica-
tion. Shuttersong is a social sharing software, just like In-
stagram2. However, the shared content contains not only an
image, but also a corresponding song clip selected by users,
which is for strengthening the expression purpose. A rele-
vant mood can also be appended by users. We collect almost
the entire updated data from Shuttersong, which consists of
36,646 pairs of images and song clips. Some optional mood
and favorite count information are also included.
In this paper, the lyric is viewed as a bridge connecting
image and song, but it is not contained in the collected data
from Shuttersong. To acquire the lyrics, we develop a soft-
ware to automatically search and download them from the
Internet based on song title and artist. However, there exist
some abnormal ones in the collected lyrics, such as non-
English songs, undetected ones, etc. Hence, we ask twenty
participants to refine the lyrics. Specifically, the participants
first exclude the non-English song, then judge whether the
lyric matches the song clip. For the incorrect or undetected
ones, the participants manually search the lyrics via the In-
ternet. Then, the refined lyrics update the original ones in
the dataset. A detailed explanation of the collected data can
be found in the supplementary material.
Statistics and analysis. The full dataset consists of 16,973
available triplets after excluding the abnormal ones, where
each triplet contains corresponding music clip3, lyric, and
image. As shown in Table 1, there are totally 6,373 differ-

Figure 3. Examples of songs and corresponding images in the
dataset. One song could relate to multiple images. It is easy to
find out the images belonging to the same song have similar con-
tent that expresses the song to some extent.
6,373 different songs in the dataset, 586 songs that appear
at least 5 times take up more than half the triplets, which
means each of these songs relates to at least 5 images. For
example, Fig. 3 shows some examples of image-song pairs,
where these songs appear more than 5 times in the built
dataset. It is obvious that the images belong to the song All
I Want For Christmas Is You are Christmas relevant, where
trees, ribbons, and lights commonly appear among them.
Meanwhile, these objects or attributes are related to some
words of the corresponding lyric to some extent and pro-
vide a similar expression with the song. We can also find
the similar situations in the other two groups, as shown in
Fig. 3. These relevant images of the same song could pro-
vide an efficient way to explore the valuable information in
lyrics and establish correlation with songs. Therefore, we
conduct our experiments based on these songs with high
occurrence frequency.
4. Our Model
In this paper, our proposed model aims at learning the
correlation between images and lyrics, which can be used
for song retrieval by image query, and vice versa. We first
introduce a CNN-based model for fully representing image
with amounts of tags, then encode the lyric sequence into
a vector representation via a bi-directional LSTM model.
A proposed multimodal model finally embeds the encoded
lyric representation into the image tag space to correlate
them under tag attention.
4.1. Image representation
We aim to generate a rich description of image, which
could point out the specific content in certain text, i.e., im-
age tags. A common strategy is to detect objects and their
attributes via extracting proposal regions and feeding them
into specific classifier [20]. Hence, we propose and clas-
sify the regions of each image via a common Region CNN
(RCNN) [30]. However, different from most of the previ-
ous works that just make use of the CNN features in the

model is developed based on faster-rcnn, which is firstly fine-tuned
on the Scene Graph Dataset [14], then used to generate the tag pre-
diction result for images in the Shuttersong dataset via parameter
transferring.
top K regions [15, 48], we use the whole prediction re-
sults to provide a richer description. We adopt the pow-
erful VGG net [34] as the CNN architecture. As shown
in Fig. 4, the CNN is first initialized from ImageNet, then
fine-tuned on the Real-World Scene Graphs Dataset [14]
that provides more object and attribute classes compared
with COCO 2014 [24] and Pascal VOC [7], where 266 ob-
ject classes and 249 attribute types4 are employed for fine-
tuning, respectively. The images in the Shuttersong dataset
are then fed into the network. The top prediction probabil-
ities of each class constitute the final image representation
as a 515-dimensional vector v.
4.2. Lyric representation
Considering the song lyric is a kind of text containing
dozens of words, we expect to generate a sufficient and effi-
cient representation to establish inner-modalities correlation
with the image representation. RNN-like architectures have
recently shown advantages in encoding sequence while con-
taining enough information for a range of natural language
processing tasks, such as language modeling [41] and trans-
lation [8]. In our work, in view of the remarkable ability
of LSTM [11] in encoding long sequence, we employ it to
embed the lyric into a vector representation but with minor
modification [9].
Words of lyric encoded in one-hot representations are
first embedded into a continuous vector space, where the
nearby points share similar semantic,
xt = Welt, (1)
where lt is the t-th word in the song lyric, and the embed-
ding matrix We is pre-trained based on the part of Google
News dataset (about 100 billion words) [27]. The weight
We is kept during the training due to overfitting concerns.
Then the word vectors constitute the lyric matrix represen-
tation and are fed into the LSTM network,
it = ? (Wixt+Uiht?1+bi) (2)
ft = ? (Wfxt+Ufht?1+bf ) (3)
C?t = tanh (Wcxt+Ucht?1+bc) (4)
Ct = it ? C?t + ft ? Ct?1 (5)
ot = ? (Woxt+Uoht?1 + bo) (6)
ht = ot ? tanh (Ct) . (7)
Three gates (input i, forget f , and output o) and one cell
memory C constitute a LSTM cell and work in cooperation
to determine whether remembering or not. ? is the sigmoid
function. And the network parameters W?, U?, and b? will
be learned during the training procedure.
4Different from the settings in [14], we select the attributes appear at
least 30 times to provide a more detailed description.

Figure 5. The diagram of the proposed model. The image content tags are first predicted via the R-CNN, meanwhile, a bi-directional LSTM
is utilized to model the corresponding lyric. Then the generated lyric representation is mapped into the space of the image tags via a MLP.
To reduce the content gap between image and lyric, the top K image tags are embedded into a tag matrix and represented as tag attention
for the lyric modeling by performing max/average pooling.
Considering the relevant images of a given lyric have
high variance in the content, such as the examples in Fig. 3,
it is difficult to directly correlate the image tags with each
embedded lyric word, especially for the longer lyric com-
pared with normal sentence [10, 42]. Hence, we just take
the final output of the LSTM, which remains the context of
single word and provides efficient information of the whole
lyric. And experiments (Sec. 5.2) indicate its effectiveness
in establishing the correlation with images. Besides, both
the forward and backward LSTM are employed to simul-
taneously model the history and future information of the
lyric, and the final lyric representation can be denoted as
l=
?

h1, where ? indicates concatenation.
4.3. Multimodal learning across image and lyric
The image and lyric representation have been extracted
via respective model, it is intuitive to embed them into a
common space to establish their correlation via a Multi-
Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, as shown in the upper part
of Fig. 5. The effectiveness of such model has been verified
in the image-text retrieval [29], this is because the text in-
formation is specially written to describe the image content,
hence there are several common features representing the
same content across both modalities. However, the MLP
model is not entirely suitable for our task. As lyric is not
specially generated for images, it can be found that there is
few lyric words directly used to describe the corresponding
image but multiple related words sharing the similar mean-
ing with image content, which could result in a content de-
scription gap. For example, we can find such situations in
the Paradise group in Fig. 3. There exists few specific lyric
words could be used for describing the beach, wave, or sky
in the images, but the words paradise, flew, and girl are re-
lated to some image contents.
To address the aforementioned problem, we propose to
use the tag attention to make the lyric words focus on the
image content, as shown in Fig. 5. We first sort the image
prediction results of all the tag classes, then choose the top-
K tags that are assumed as the correct prediction of corre-
sponding image content5. To share the representation space
with lyric words, the selected tags are also embedded into a
vector of continuous value via Eq. 1, which results in a tag
matrix T ? RK×300. Then we perform the pooling opera-
tion over the matrix T into a tag attention vector v?. Inspired
by the work of Hermann et al. [10] and Tan et al. [42], the
tag attention is designed to modify the output vector of the
LSTM and make the lyric words focus on the concrete im-
age content. To be specific, the output vector ht at time step
t is updated as follows,
mt = ? (Whmht +Wvmv?) (8)
st ? exp
(
wTmsmt
)
(9)
h?t = htst, (10)
where the weights Whm, Wvm, and wms are considered as
the attention degree of the lyric words given the image con-
tent (tags). During modeling the lyrics, the related words
are paid more attention via the attention weights, which
acts like the TF-IDF in document retrieval based on key
words. However, different from the pooling operation over
the entire sequence in the previous works [10, 42], the out-
put vector with attention, h?t, just flow through the entire
lyric words, which results in a refined lyric representation.
5The top 5 tags are validated and employed in this paper.
During training, we aims at minimizing the difference
between the image and lyric pair in the tag space, which is
essentially the Mean Squared Error (MSE),
lmse =
T
?
i=1
?
?
?
vi ? l?i
?

, (11)
where vi and l?i are the generated image and projected lyric
representation, and T is the number of training pairs. Ex-
cept the MSE loss, we also employ the cosine proximity and
marginal ranking loss. The relevant experiment results are
reported in the materials. For the retrieval, both the query
and retrieved items are fed into the proposed model, then
the cosine similarity is computed as the relevance.
4.4. Optimization
The proposed model is optimized by employing stochas-
tic gradient descent with RMSprop [43]. The algorithm
adaptively rescales the step size for updating trainable
weights according to the corresponding gradient history,
which achieves the best result when faced with the word
frequency disparity in lyric modeling. The parameters are
empirically set as: the learning rate l = 0.001, the weight
decay ? = 0.9, the tiny constant ? = 10?8, and The model
is trained with mini-batches of 100 image-lyric pairs.
5. Experiments
5.1. Data preprocessing and setup
Dataset. In this paper, we choose the triplets whose lyrics
appear at least 5 times, which results in 8,849 triplets (586
songs). Such operation is a common preprocessing method
and also better for learning the correlation across modali-
ties. To reduce the influence of the imbalanced number of
images, we choose five triplets with top favorite counts for
each song, which are considered to have more reliable cor-
relation. Within these filtered triplets, 100 songs and cor-
responding images are randomly selected for testing, and
the rest for training, which forms dataset†. Note that, we
also employ another kind of train/test partition to constitute
dataset§: we randomly select one from five images of each
song for testing, and the rest for training. In the dataset§, the
train and test set share the same 586 songs but with different
images, which is developed to exactly evaluate the models
in shrinking the content gap, when faced with variable im-
age content and lack of related lyric words.
Preprocessing. For the lyric data preprocessing, we remove
all the non-alphanumeric and stop words.
Metric. We employ the rank-based evaluation metrics.
R@K is Recall@K that computes the percentage of a cor-
rect result found in the top-K retrieved items (higher is bet-
ter), and Med r is the median rank of the closest correct
retrieved item (lower is better).
Baselines. In our experiments, we compare with the
following models: Bag-of-Words [1]: The image fea-
tures and lyric BoW representation are mapped into a
common subspace. CONSE [29]: The lyric representa-
tion is obtained by performing pooling operation over all
words and then established correlation with image features.
Attentive-Reader [10]: This method is mainly developed
for Question-Answering task, which performs a weighted
pooling over the encoded words via LSTM with question
attention. Here, the question attention is replaced with the
image tag attention, and a non-linear combination is used to
measure the correlation.
Our Models. We evaluate two variants of our models: Our
baseline model: Our proposed model except the tag atten-
tion, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 5. Our-attention
model: The proposed complete model. Note that, aver-
age pooling is employed for obtaining tag attention, which
could remain more image content information compared
with max-manner.
5.2. Image2song retrieval
This experiment aims to evaluate the song retrieval per-
formance by given image query. There are two kinds of
tags used for representing images, i.e., object and attribute.
It is expected to explore which kind of them influences the
image description most and provides more valuable infor-
mation to establish the correlation across the two modali-
ties. In view of this, we group the image tags into three
categories, i.e., object, attribute, and both of them. Table. 4
shows the comparison results on both datasets, where both
the model variants and other methods are considered. And
we also provide example retrieval results in Fig. 6.
For each tag category, there are three points we should
pay attention to. First, the bi-directional LSTM model
provides better lyric representations than direct pooling
(CONSE [29]) and BoW [1], as the LSTM takes consider-
ation of both word semantic and context information. Sec-
ond, the proposed complete model shows the best result in
most conditions. When we employ the tag attention for
lyric modeling, more related words in the lyrics will be
emphasized, which shrinks the content gap and improves
the relevant performance, especially on the dataset§. Al-
though Attentive-Reader [10] also employ similar manner,
it takes the attentive pooling result as the lyric representa-
tion. The direct pooling operation in Attentive-Reader will
make it suffer from the difficulty in establishing correlation,
this is because the variable image contents change the at-
tention weight. While our model takes the final output of
LSTM, where the attention weight is not immediately uti-
lized but conveyed by the updated output vector h?t. Third,
although our methods show the best performance on both
datasets, overall performance is not excellent as expected.
But this is a common situation in the semantic-based mu-

sic retrieval [32]. This is because the song retrieval based
on textual data has to estimate the semantic labels from
lyric, which is charactered as a low specificity and long-
term granularity [32]. Even so, our proposed models still
enjoy a relatively big improvement, and the retrieved exam-
ples show the effectiveness of the models in Fig. 6.
Across the three groups of image tags, we could find that
the attribute tags almost always perform worse than object
ones. We consider there are mainly three reasons to ex-
plain this phenomenon. First, the object words are usually
employed for image description, which is more powerful in
identifying the image content compared with attribute ones.
Second, as the Shuttersong is actually a kind of sharing ap-
plication, most of the updated images are self-photography,
which makes it difficult to correlate images with songs, es-
pecially for the attribute tags. Third, most of the images
share similar attribute tags with high prediction scores (e.g.,
black, blue, white). This is actually a long-tailed distri-
bution6 and therefore it becomes difficult to establish the
correlation between image and specific lyric. However, the
group with both tags nearly shows the best performance
across different models, which results from more detailed
description for images.
Apart from the influence of image tag property, the lyric
also impacts the performance significantly. We show the
specific results of 28 songs with more 50 times occurrence
in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. As shown, some song lyrics are of

remarkable performance, while some fail to establish the
correlation with relevant images. The potential reason is
that parts of the lyrics are weak in providing obvious or
even related words. For example, the lyric words of Best
Friends are about forget, tonight, remember, etc, which are
not specifically related to the image content, as shown in
Fig. 3. Even so, our proposed tag attention mechanism can
still reduce the content gap and improve the performance, as
show in Fig. 7. While for the song Paradise and All I Want
For Christmas Is You, the lyric words and image content are
closely related, hence this case achieves better results.
5.3. Song2image retrieval
In this experiment, we aims to retrieve relevant images
for a given song (lyric) query, which is similar to the music
visualization task. And we employ the proposed baseline
model, which could perform more efficiently without the
attention of each image. Table. 6 shows the comparison re-
sults on dataset†. First, our proposed model outperforms
the method of Schwarz et al. [33]. In our model, the im-
age content information are employed to supervise the lyric

modeling during training, while Schwarz et al. [33] directly
use the pooling results of lyric word vector for similarity
retrieval without the inner-model interaction like ours. Sec-
ond, although our model get better performance, it still suf-
fers from the lack of related words in some songs, just like
the image2song task.
In addition, we also show some examples of the song
query, and the top 4 retrieved results are illustrated in Fig. 9.
Although some retrieved results are not correct, they share
similar content conveyed by the lyric. For example, in terms
of the song Cedarwood Road about tree and Christmas, the
top two retrieved images indeed have tree-relevant content
and the left two are about Christmas.
6. Discussion
In this paper, we introduce a novel problem that retrieves
semantic-related songs based on given images, which is
named as the image2song task. We collect a dataset that
consists of pairwise images and songs to study this prob-
lem. We propose a semantic-based song retrieval frame-
work, which employs the lyric as the textual data source for
estimating the semantic label of songs, then a deep neural
network based multimodal framework is proposed to learn
the correlation, where the lyric modeling is proposed to fo-
cus on the main image content to reduce the content gap
between them. The experiment results show that our model
can recommend suitable songs for a given image. In addi-
tion, the proposed approach can also retrieve relevant im-
ages according to a song query with a better performance
than other methods.
There still remains a direction that should be explored
in the future. Song is about several minutes long, which is
too long for just showing an image. A possible way could
be expected is to correlate the image with only parts of the
corresponding song, which is more natural for expression.
Furthermore, we also hope to perform other kinds of cross-
modal retrieval task, which essentially attempts to establish
the correlation among different senses of human.

8. The Shuttersong Dataset
8.1. Favorite Count
Apart from the song clip, image, and mood, we also col-
lect the favorite count for each image-song pair from the
Shuttersong application. The favorite counts vary from 1 to
8,964, which could be used to estimate the quality of image-
song pairs as a reference. The specific statistics can be
found in Fig. 10. There are 6,043 (image, music clip, lyric)
triplets owning at least 3 favorite counts, which are consid-
ered to jointly show better expressions compared with the
others.

Figure 10. The statistics of triplet number in favorite counts. There
are 1,547 triplets owning at least 10 favorite counts, which could
be considered as the image-song pair with high quality.
8.2. Lyric Refinement
As there are some abnormal lyrics existing in the au-
tomatically searched set, it is necessary to verify each of
them. Hence, we ask twenty participants to refine the
lyrics, and the corresponding flow char of the refinement
is shown in Fig. 11. First, the participants judge whether
the song is in English or not. Then they select the mis-
match ones and conduct manual searching for the filtered
English songs. The websites used for searching in this pa-
per are www.musixmatch.com and search.azlyrics.com. Fi-
nally, both the correct matching and successfully updated
ones constitute the refined lyric set. And the rest lyrics are
the abnormal ones, e.g. non-English songs, unfound lyrics.
9. Additional Experiments
We have shown the specific comparison results of the
28 songs with more 50 times occurrence in the paper, The
following subsections show more results of our models with
these songs, as well as other compared models.
9.1. More Retrieval Results
Apart from the lyric words and image features, we also
take consideration of the mood information, which is com-
bined with the encoded lyric representation, but only 18.6%
is available. As shown in Table 4, the extra mood informa-
tion indeed strengthens the correlation between image and
lyric, which even outperforms the attention model in some
cases. This is because the mood tag directly points out the
core information of the shared image-song pair and there-
fore makes the pair become closer.
9.2. Pooling Operation
The tag attention is obtained by performing the pooling
operation over the tag matrix, which plays an important role
in establishing the correlation between image and lyric. In
view of this, the average and max pooling strategy are com-
pared to evaluate their performances in remaining effective
image content. Table. 5 shows the comparison results. It
is clear that using average pooling is much better than max
pooling. The potential reason is that the average pooling
could extract more tag semantic values from the tag matrix,
so that more tag values provide a more complete description
for images.
9.3. Loss Comparison
In addition to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss func-
tion employed in the paper, Cosine Proximity Loss (CPL)
and Marginal Ranking Loss (MRL) are also considered.
CPL is based on the cosine distance, which is commonly
used in vector space model and written as follow,
lcpl = ?
T
?
i=1
cos
(
vi, l?i
)
. (12)
As for MRL, it takes consideration of both positive and neg-
ative samples with respect to the images query and is more
prevalent in retrieval tasks. It belongs to the hinge loss and
is written as,
lmrl =
T
?
i=1
max
{
0, 1 + cos
(
vi, l?
?
i
)
? cos
(
vi, l?
+
i
)}
,
(13)
where l?+i is the ground truth lyric for current image rep-
resentation vi, and l?
?
i is a negative one that is randomly
selected from the entire lyric database.
Table. 7 shows the comparison results among the three
introduced loss functions. It is obvious that MSE performs
the best in both Recall@K and Med r metric, while MRL
has the worst performance. We consider that the main rea-
son comes from the diversity of images, e.g. the examples
in Fig. 12. The images related to the same lyrics have high
variance in the appearance, which makes these two modal-
ities lack the content correspondence to each other. Hence,
it becomes more challenging to deal with the positive and
negative samples simultaneously. Such conditions can be
also found in the image-to-text retrieval task [6].
9.4. Attribute Property
In our paper, the attribute tags perform worse than the
object ones, one of the potential reasons is due to the im-

attribute (attr), and both them (obj-attr).
Would U Love Me
I've got a question, tell me why, you always fall for the bad guy?
It's cuz you like it, yeah you like it.
When I look at other girls walking by I say hello, 
cause you don't mind it, I think you like it I don't know why you like it.
By the way, last week Saturday, was our Anniversary, I was playing GTA.
Damn I'm Sorry.
Would you love me, Would you love me.
If I wasn't such a jerk?
But you love me, yeah you love me cuz you like it when it hurts.
Try to be, all but nice.
But it doesn't seem to work.
Would you tell me that you love me, If I wasn't such a jerk?
I DON'
T THINK SO!!
I used to treat you like a queen, but it never worked out right for me.
You didn't like it, you never liked it.
I know you're parent's hate my life, but it always seems to make you smile, 
Because you like it, I guess you like it I don't know why you like it.
By the way, coming up on Saturday, isn't it your birthday?
I'll be playing GTA.
Damn I'm Sorry.
Would you love me, Would you love me.
If I wasn't such a jerk?
But you love me, yeah you love me cuz you like it when it hurts.
Try to be, all but nice.
But it doesn't seem to work.
Would you tell me that you love me, If I wasn't such a jerk?
Shallow Love
Everywhere I go, I see love turnin' into somethin' it's not
People caught with the image, when's this shit gon' stop?
When he gets down on his knee and that question gets popped
She's like, "Yes, babe!" Eyes still locked at the rock
He's got bands, he wants a pretty lady who wants a Mercedes-Benz
So they can both show off to their friends
They're in the whip, they're in the penthouse and they're in the jet to France
Damn, it seems like love's the only thing that they ain't in
Divin' in headfirst into some shallow waters
I'm just touchin' on a subject that I feel is kinda catastrophic
I'm not sayin' every couple with money's got this problem
But in some cases without the label, she'd be straight up robbin'
Takin' vows to the coffin on the wedding day
Ain't no prenupt needed, she convinced him it's true
Perfectly curved, believin' every word that she spewed
Was blinded by the beauty, can't see through
Is this shallow love?
Or is it something real?
You make it hard to deal
Not knowin' if this is shallow love
The way we live so well
Can make it hard to tell
What she in it for?
What she really in it for?
I don't even fucking know...

sidered. There are 249 attribute types employed in this pa-
per, and Fig. 13 shows the average prediction results. It is
clear to find that only a few types have high value, while
most remain the low probabilities, which is actually a kind
of long-tailed distribution. The imbalanced results could
make it difficult to distinguish the images that belong to
different songs. More importantly, the top 9 attributes are
almost color-related, as shown in Table. 6. These attributes
commonly appear in colorful images, and therefore become

pared with other ones, e.g. happy, messy. Hence, only em-
ploying attribute tags may suffer from the aforementioned
problems and result in the unreliable correlation.
