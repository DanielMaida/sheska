Joint Multi-view Face Alignment in the Wild
Jiankang Deng, Student Member, IEEE, George Trigeorgis, Yuxiang Zhou, and Stefanos Zafeiriou, Member, IEEE
Abstract—The de facto algorithm for facial landmark es-
timation involves running a face detector with a subsequent
deformable model fitting on the bounding box. This encompasses
two basic problems: i) the detection and deformable fitting
steps are performed independently, while the detector might not
provide best-suited initialisation for the fitting step, ii) the face
appearance varies hugely across different poses, which makes the
deformable face fitting very challenging and thus distinct models
have to be used (e.g., one for profile and one for frontal faces). In
this work, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, joint
multi-view convolutional network to handle large pose variations
across faces in-the-wild, and elegantly bridge face detection and
facial landmark localisation tasks. Existing joint face detection
and landmark localisation methods focus only on a very small
set of landmarks. By contrast, our method can detect and align
a large number of landmarks for semi-frontal (68 landmarks)
and profile (39 landmarks) faces. We evaluate our model on
a plethora of datasets including standard static image datasets
such as IBUG, 300W, COFW, and the latest Menpo Benchmark
for both semi-frontal and profile faces. Significant improvement
over state-of-the-art methods on deformable face tracking is
witnessed on 300VW benchmark. We also demonstrate state-of-
the-art results for face detection on FDDB and MALF datasets.

I. INTRODUCTION
OBJECT detection in computer vision has seen a hugeamount of attention in recent years [1], [2], [3]. The
advances in deep learning and the use of more elaborate
models, such as Inception [4] and ResNet [5], have allowed
for reliable and fine-scale non-rigid object detection even in
challenging scenarios. Out of all the objects probably the most
studied one is the human face. Face detection, although having
embedded in our everyday lives through the use of digital
cameras and social media, is still an extremely challenging
problem as shown by the recent survey [6].
Human face in images captured in unconstrained conditions
(also referred to as “in-the-wild”) is a challenging object, since
facial appearance can change dramatically due to extreme
pose, defocus, low resolution and occlusion. Face detection
“in-the-wild” is still regarded as a challenging task. That
is, considerable effort was needed in order to appropriately
customise a generic object methodology, e.g. Deformable Part-
Based Models [7] and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(DCNNs) [1], in order to devise pipelines that achieve very
good performance in face detection [8], [7], [9].
This work was partially funded by EPSRC project EP/N007743/1
(FACER2VM), as well as by the European Community Horizon 2020
[H2020/2014-2020] under grant agreement no. 688520 (TeSLA).

Model (MHM). The profile and frontal faces are trained jointly, and the model
is robust under large pose variations.
Specifically, when dealing with human face we are also
interested in detailed face alignment, that is, localising a
collection of facial landmarks on face images. This step plays
an important role in many face analysis task, such as face
recognition [10], [11], [12], expression recognition [13], [14],
and face animation [15]. Due to the importance of the problem,
a large number of facial landmark localisation methods have
been proposed in the past two decades [16], [17], [18], [19],
[20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], and the previous works
can be categorised as parametric fitting based [16], [17],
[18], [27] and non-parametric regression based [19], [20],
[21], [22], [23], [24], [26]. The former aims at minimising
the discrepancy between the model appearance and the input
image. The latter extracts features from the image and directly
regresses to the ground truth landmarks. With the increasing
number of training data [28], the performance of regression-
based methods is generally better than that of parametric fitting
based methods.
Recently, it was shown that it is advantageous to perform
jointly face detection and facial landmark localisation [29], [9].
Nevertheless, due to the high cost of facial landmark localisa-
tion step, only few landmarks were detected [9]. Furthermore,
in [9] the method made use of extra 400K facial images from
the web which are not publicly available. To avoid this, we
propose a coarse-to-fine joint multi-view landmark localisation
architecture. In the coarse step, few landmarks are localised,
while in the fine stage, we detect a large number of landmarks
(e.g., 68/39). In our methodology, for reproducibility, we made
use of publicly available data only.
Face alignment and tracking across medium poses, where
all the landmarks are visible, has been well addressed [21],
[22], [23]. However, face alignment across large poses is still
a challenging problem with limited attention. There are two

views. Red annotation is from 2D view, and green annotation is from 3D
view.
main challenges: Firstly, there is a controversy on landmark
definition, from 2D view or 3D view? As is shown in Figure 2,
facial landmarks are always located at the visible face bound-
ary in the 2D annotation. Faces which exhibit large facial poses
are extremely challenging to annotate, because the landmarks
on the invisible face side stack together. Since the invisible
face contour needs to be always guessed to be consistent with
3D face models, labelling the self-occluded 3D landmarks is
also ambiguous for annotators. Secondly, since occlusions can
occur on both frontal and profile face images, designing a
single shape constraint is hard for large pose face alignment.
As view variation is continuous, view-specific modelling [30],
[31] inevitably brings the problem of view classification and
increases the computation cost.
In this work we present the first, to the best of our knowl-
edge, method for deformable face modelling which jointly
detects the face and localises a large amount of landmarks.
1) We employ a coarse-to-fine strategy where a face de-
tector is first applied to find a coarse estimate of the
facial shape using a small subset of landmarks. After
removing the similarity transformation, a refining step
is performed to estimate the dense facial shape of each
person.
2) We formulate a novel Multi-view Hourglass Model
(MHM) which tries to jointly estimate both semi-frontal
and profile facial landmarks. Different from the other
methods which employ distinct models, we try to cap-
italise on the correspondences between the profile and
frontal facial shapes.
3) We demonstrate huge improvement over the state-of-
the-art results in the latest benchmarks for deformable
face fitting such as IBUG, 300W, COFW and the lat-
est Menpo Benchmark. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
results for the deformable face tracking on the 300VW
benchmark and face detection on FDDB and MALF.
II. RELATED WORK
To better understand the problem of deformable face fitting,
we review three of the major related elements.
Besides traditional models (such as AAMs [17], CLMs [18]
and regression models [21], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]),
recently DCNNs has been employed in face alignment [24],
[37], [38]. The resolution loss within the pooling step in
DCNN was compensated by the image enlargement in a global
to local way. Zhang et al. [39] adopted the similar coarse-to-
fine framework with auto-encoder networks. Ranjan et al. [40]
combined outputs of multi-resolution convolutional layers to
predict the landmark locations. After the presentation of the
fully-convolutional network (FCN) [38], which takes input of
arbitrary size, produces a correspondingly-sized dense label
map and shows convincing results for semantic image seg-
mentation, direct landmark coordinated prediction changed to
the landmark response map prediction. Lai et al. [41], Xiao et
al. [42] and Bulat et al. [43] employed the convolutional and
de-convolutional network to generate the response map for
each facial landmark, and added a refinement step by utilising
a network that performs regression. In the area of articulated
human pose estimation, Alejandro et al. [44] proposed a novel
stacked hourglass model, which repeated bottom-up and top-
down processing in conjunction with intermediate supervision
and obtained state-of-the-art result. Bulat et al. [45] further
explored binarized Hourglass-like convolutional network for
face alignment with limited resources.
Despite the large volume of work on semi-frontal face align-
ment, literature on the large-pose scenario is rather limited.
This is attributed to the fact that large-pose face alignment
is a very challenging task, until now there are not enough
annotated facial images in arbitrary poses (especially with a
large number of landmarks). A step towards this direction is
the data presented in the new facial landmark competition [46].
The most common method in large-pose image alignment is
the multi-view AAMs framework [30], which uses different
landmark configurations for different views. However, since
each view has to be tested, the computation cost of multi-
view method is always high. In [8], [47] the methods utilised
the DPM framework to combine face detection and alignment,
and the best view fitting was selected by the highest pos-
sibility. Since non-frontal faces are one type of occlusions,
Wu et al. [48] proposed a unified robust cascade regression
framework that can handle both images with severe occlusion
and images with large head poses by iteratively predicting the
landmark visible status and the landmark locations.
To solve the problem of large pose face alignment, 3D face
fitting methodologies have been considered [49], [50], [25],
which aims to fit a 3D morphable model (3DMM) [51] to
a 2D image. [49] aligned faces of arbitrary poses with the
assist of a sparse 3D point distribution model. The model
parameter and projection matrix are estimated by the cascaded
linear or nonlinear regressors. [50] extended [49] by fitting a
dense 3D morphable model, employing the CNN regressor
with 3D-enabled features, and estimating contour landmarks.
[25] fitted a dense 3D face model to the image via CNN
and synthesised large-scale training samples in profile views
to solve the problem of data labelling. 3D face alignment
methods model the 3D face shape with a linear subspace and
achieve fitting by minimising the difference between image
and model appearance. Although 3D alignment methods can
cover arbitrary poses, the accuracy of alignment is bounded by
the linear parametric 3D model, and the invisible landmarks
are predicted after the visible appearance are fitted. In this pa-
per, we focus on non-parametric visible landmark localisation.
Finally, we assess our methodology for facial landmark

tracking in 300VW [52]. The current state-of-the-art around
face deformable tracking boils down to a pipeline which
combines a generic face detection algorithm with a facial
landmark localisation method [53]. Variants of this pipeline
with different detectors or deformable models appear in the
related paper [53]. The pipeline is quite robust since the
probability of drifting is reduced due to the application of the
face detector at each frame. We demonstrate that by applying
the proposed methodology, large improvements over the state-
of-the-art can be achieved.
III. OUR METHOD
In Figure 3, we shown the pipeline of the proposed coarse-
to-fine joint multi-view deformable face fitting method. First,
face proposals are generated by a small fully convolutional
network on the image pyramid. Then, these face boxes are
classified and regressed to predict the five facial landmarks.
Afterwards, the similarity transformation between faces are
removed using the five facial landmarks, and the response map
for each landmark estimate is calculated by the joint multi-
view hourglass model. Lastly, we make the final prediction of
each landmark based on the corresponding response map.
A. Face Region Normalisation
The training of our face detection module follows the
exact design of three cascade network and sampling strategies
in [54]. In that, we minimise an objective function with the
multi-task loss. For each face box i, its loss function is defined
as:
L = L1(pi, p
?
i ) + ?1p
?
iL2(ti, t
?
i ) + ?2p
?
iL3(li, l
?
i ), (1)
where pi is the probability of box i being a face; p?i is a binary
indicator (1 for positive and 0 for negative examples); the
classification loss L1 is the softmax loss of two classes (face
/ non-face); ti = {tx, ty, tw, th}i and t?i = {t?x, t?y, t?w, t?h}i
represent the coordinates of the predicted box and ground truth
box correspondingly. li = {lx1 , ly1 , · · · , lx5 , ly5}i and l?i =
{l?x1 , l
?
y1 , · · · , l
?
x5 , l
?
y5}i represent the predicted and ground
truth five facial landmarks. The box and the landmark regres-
sion targets are normalised by the face size of the ground truth.
We use L2(ti, t?i ) = R(ti ? t?i ) and L3(li, l?i ) = Rv?i (li ? l?i )
for the box and landmark regression loss, respectively, where
R is the robust loss function (smooth-L1) defined in [2]. In
Figure 4, we give the network structure of the third cascade
network with multi-task loss.
One core idea of our method is to incorporate a spatial
transformation [55] which is responsible for warping the
original image into a canonical representation such that the
later alignment task is simplified. Recent work (e.g., [56])
has explored this idea on face recognition and witnessed
an improvement on the performance. In Figure 5, the five
facial landmark localisation network (Figure 4) as the spatial
transform layer is trained to map the original image to the
parameters of a warping function (e.g., a similarity transform),
such that the subsequent alignment network is evaluated on a
translation, rotation and scale invariant face image, therefore,
potentially reducing the trainable parameters as well as the dif-
ficulty in learning large pose variations. Since different training
data are used in face region normalisation (CelebA [57] and
AFLW [58]) and multi-view alignment (300W [28] and Menpo
Benchmark [46] ), end-to-end training of these two networks
with intermediate supervision on the face region normalisation
step is equal to step-wise training. In this paper, we employ
step-wise cascade structure, and the face region normalisation
step benefits from larger training data as annotation of the five
facial landmarks is much easier than dense annotation.
B. Multi-view Hourglass Model
Hourglass [44] is designed based on Residual blocks [5],
[59], which can be represented as follows:
xn+1 = H(xn) + F (xn,Wn), (2)
where xn and xn+1 are the input and output of the n-th unit,
and F is the stacked convolution, batch normalisation, and
ReLU non-linearity. Hourglass is a symmetric top-down and
bottom-up full convolutional network. The original signals are
branched out before each down-sampling step and combined
together before each up-sampling step to keep the resolution
information. n scale Hourglass is able to extract features from
the original scale to 1/2n scale and there is no resolution
loss in the whole network. The increasing depth of network
design helps to increase contextual region, which incorporates
global shape inference and increases robustness when local
observation is blurred.
Based on the Hourglass model [44], we formulate the Multi-
view Hourglass Model (MHM) which tries to jointly estimate
both semi-frontal (68 landmarks) and profile (39 landmarks)
face shapes. Unlike other methods which employ distinct
models, we try to capitalise on the correspondences between
the profile and frontal facial shapes. As shown in Figure 6,
for each landmark on the profile face, the nearest landmark
on the frontal face is regarded as its corresponding landmark
in the union set, thus we can form the union landmark set with
68 landmarks (U-68). Considering that the landmark definition
varies in frontal and profile data, we also enlarge the union
set to 86 landmarks (U-86) by dissimilating two landmarks
from eyebrow and seven landmarks from the lower part of
face contour for profile annotation. During the training, we
use the view status to select the corresponding response maps
for the loss computation.

where mn(i, j) and m?n(i, j) represent the estimated and the
ground truth response maps at pixel location (i, j) for the n-th
landmark correspondingly, and vn ? {0, 1} is the indicator to
select the corresponding response map to calculate the final
loss. We can see from Figure 6 that the semi-frontal response
maps (second and forth examples in third row) benefit from the
joint multi-view training, and the proposed method is robust
and stable in a range of poses.
Based on the multi-view response maps, we extract shape-
indexed patch (24×24) around each predicted landmark from

the down-sampled face image (128 × 128). As shown in
Figure 7, a small classification network is trained to classify
face / non-face. This classifier is not only used to remove
high score false positives for face detection, but also can be
employed as a failure checker for deformable face tracking.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experiment Setting
1) Training Data: Face Detection Model: The face de-
tection module before the multi-view face alignment step
follows the cascaded network design and sampling strategies
as in [54]. We crop positive faces (IoU > 0.6), negative
faces (IoU < 0.3) and part faces (IoU ? (0.4, 0.65)) from
Wider Face [60] training set. To guarantee a high accuracy in
predicting five facial landmarks, we employ additional labelled
faces from the AFLW [58] dataset besides labelled faces from
CelebA [57]. For the additional classifier after the multi-view
alignment step, the positive (IoU > 0.5) and negative samples
(IoU < 0.3) are generated from the previous cascaded face
detector. Multi-view Hourglass Model: We train the face
alignment module MHM on the 300W database [28], and the
Menpo Benchmark database [46], where faces are manually
annotated with either 68 (semi-frontal face) or 39 (profile face)
Fig. 6: Multi-view Hourglass Model. First row: facial landmark configuration
for frontal (68 landmarks) and profile (39 landmarks) faces [46]. We define
a union landmark set with 68 landmarks for frontal and profile shape. For
each landmark on the profile face, the nearest landmark on the frontal face is
selected as the same definition in the union set. Third row: landmark response
maps for all view faces. The response maps for semi-frontal faces (2nd and
4th) benefit from the joint multi-view training.

landmarks. The training set of the 300W database (we denote
as 300W-68) consists of the LFPW trainset [61], the Helen
trainset [62] and the AFW dataset [8], hence, a total of 3148
images are available. The Menpo Benchmark database [46]
(denoted as Menpo-39-68) consists of 5658 semi-frontal face
images and 1906 profile face images. In this paper, we defined
two training sets (300W-68-Menpo-39 and 300W-68-Menpo-
39-68) for different evaluation purposes. 300W-68-Menpo-39
includes the 300W-68 data and the profile faces of Menpo-39,
while 300W-68-Menpo-39-68 groups all the available training
images in 300W-68 and Menpo-39-68.
2) Testing data: Face detection: We evaluate the per-
formance of our face detection module in two challenging
JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 4, NO. 5, APRIL 2015 5
datasets, FDDB and MALF. FDDB consists of 5171 faces
in 2845 images from the unconstrained environment. MALF
is a fine-grained evaluation dataset, in total, there are 5250
images with 11931 annotated faces. The “hard” subset contains
faces (larger than 60 × 60) with huge variations in pose,
expression, or occlusion. In particular, we give detailed pose-
specific evaluations on MALF. Face alignment in images &
videos: Evaluations of single face alignment and face tracking
are performed in several in-the-wild databases. For alignment
in static image, we test on IBUG dataset, 300W testset [28],
COFW [63], [64], and Menpo-test [46]. All these databases
are collected under fully unconstrained conditions and exhibit
large variations in pose, expression, illumination, etc. In
particular, Menpo-test [46] collects faces of all different poses,
which are categorised into 5535 semi-frontal faces and 1946
profile faces based on [46]. For face tracking experiment,
300VW is the only publicly available in-the-wild benchmark.
It consists of 114 videos (about 218k frames in total), captured
in the wild with large pose variations, severe occlusions and
extreme illuminations.
3) Evaluation Metric: Given the ground truth, the landmark
localisation performance can be evaluated by Normalised
Mean Error (NME), and the normalisation is typically carried
out with respect to face size.

where M is the number of images in the test set, N is the
number of landmarks, p is the prediction, g is the ground
truth, and d is the normalise distance. According to the
protocol of difference facial alignment benchmarks, various
normalise distances are used in this paper, such as eye centre
distance [22], outer eye corner distance [28] and diagonal
distance of ground truth bounding box [53]. The permissible
error (localisation threshold) is taken as a percentage of the
normalise distance.
4) Training of Multi-view Hourglass Model: The training of
the proposed method follows a similar design as in the Hour-
glass Model [44]. Before the training, several pre-processing
steps are undertaken. We firstly remove scale, rotation and
translation differences by five facial landmarks among the
training face images (referred as the spatial transformer step),
then crop and resize the face regions to 256×256. We augment
the data with rotation (+/- 30 degrees), scaling (0.75-1.25),
and translation (+/- 20 pixels) that would help simulate the
variations from face detector and five landmark localisation.
The full network starts with a 7× 7 convolutional layer with
stride 2, followed by a residual module and a round of max
pooling to bring the resolution down from 256 to 64, as it
could save GPU memory while preserving alignment accuracy.
The network is trained using Tensorflow [65] with an initial
learning rate of 1e-4, batch size of 12, and learning steps
of 100k. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is applied to
compare the predicted heatmaps to the ground-truth heatmaps.
Each training step takes 1.2s on one NVIDIA GTX Titan X
(Pascal) GPU card. During testing, face regions are cropped
and resized to 256×256, and it takes 12.21ms to generate the
response maps.
B. Ablation Study
We consider different training strategies and validate these
setting on the challenging IBUG dataset in Table I. (1)
Hourglass Model (HM) trained on 300W-68. (2) HM trained
on 300W-68, with spatial transformer step based on five
facial landmarks. (3) HM trained on 300W-68 with simulated
response maps from the output five landmarks. The input
channel increases from 3 to 8, and this Hourglass model is
trained with the spatial facial clue from face detector. The
result of Method 3 is worse than that of Method 2, which
indicates that the spatial transformer step for each face region
is better than the spatial indication. (4) Multi-view Hourglass
Model (MHM) trained on 300W-68-Menpo-39 with 68 union

performance but doubling the computation cost.

From the ablation experiments, we could conclude that
by integrating the spatial transformer step, joint multi-view
training and feeding more quality training data, the robustness
and accuracy of proposed method improve hugely. As shown
in Figure 8, although responses are more evident on facial
organs than those on face contour, owing to more available
profile training data, the proposed joint Multi-view Hourglass
Model is able to deal with large pose variation.

C. Face Alignment on Images
We present experimental results on three face image
databases, 300W database [28], COFW [63], [64] dataset and
Menpo Benchmark [46]. The alignment method we evaluate
here is the proposed Multi-view Hourglass Model (MHM),
where the -Norm means the spatial transformer, and the -
U-86 means the union 86 landmarks. Experiment results on
300W database are shown in Figure 9, where we compared
the proposed methods with the best results in the 300W
competition [28], such as Deng et al. [31] and Fan et al. [66].
Besides, we also compare with the state-of-the-art face align-
ment method “DenseReg + MDM” [67]. It is obvious that
our model (Menpo-39-68-300W-68-U-68-Norm) outperforms
those methods by a large margin. Table II reports the area
under the curve (AUC) of the CED curves, as well as the
failure rate for a maximum error of 0.1. Apart from the
accuracy improvement shown by the AUC, we believe that
the reported failure rate of 0.33% is remarkable and highlights
the robustness of our MHM. Additionally, we found that the
union landmark definition only has little influence on semi-
frontal face alignment accuracy. Thus we stick to the union
68 landmarks definition to avoid any confusion.

stands for the spatial transformer step from five facial landmarks. “U” stands
for the union set number of profile and frontal data.
We also present the performance of the MHM on the
COFW [63], [64] dataset. Robust face alignment under occlu-
sion and occluded landmark prediction are coupled problem
that could be resolved simultaneously. Given the landmark
occlusion status, local observation noise can be removed and
the occluded landmark location can be predicted by shape
context or constraint. Given a good fitting result, exploiting
the fact that appearance of occluded region is quite different
from the normal face appearance, even the simplest binary
classifier could achieve excellent performance on occlusion
classification. In Figure 10, we show the result of the pro-
posed method comparing with state-of-the-art methods on
COFW [63], such as HPM [68], SAPM [69], CFSS [23],
TCDCN [70], and RCPR [63]. It can be clearly seen that
even the baseline Hourglass model obtains a much better result
because the bottom-up and top-down processing steps model
the scale variations that would benefit the context inference.
Moreover, by adding the spatial transformer, joint multi-view
training and combined training data step-by-step, we gradually

improved the alignment result, with the final success rate
approaching 97.44%. Based on our best result, we employ the
adaptive exemplar dictionary method [71] to predict occlusion
status and refine the occluded landmarks. The normalised
mean error decreases from 5.69% to 5.58%, and the occlusion
prediction obtains a recall rate of 70.36% at the precision
rate of 85.97%. In Figure 11, we give some fitting examples
on COFW under heavy occlusions. To our surprise, responses
of the occluded parts are still very clear and evident, which
would prevent weird fitting results. This suggests that the
proposed method captures and consolidates information across
whole face images under different conditions, and incorporates
local observation and global shape context in an implicit data-
driven way, and thus improves the model’s robustness under
occlusions.

of the competition [46]. We draw the curve of cumulative error
distribution on semi-frontal and profile test data separately.
The proposed method has similar performance to the best
performing methods in semi-frontal faces. Nevertheless, it
outperforms the best performing method in profile faces.
Despite that result on profile data is worse than that on semi-
frontal data, both of their normalised (by diagonal length of
bounding box) fitting errors of our method are remarkably
small, approaching 1.48% and 1.27% for profile and semi-
frontal faces respectively. In Figure 13, we give some fitting
examples on the Menpo test set. As we can see from the
alignment results, the proposed multi-view hourglass model
is robust under pose variations, exaggerate expressions and
occlusions on both semi-frontal and profile subset.

D. Face Alignment on Videos
We employ the 300VW challenge [52] testset for the chal-
lenging task of deformable face tracking on videos. Using our
joint MHM method, We perform a frame-by-frame tracking
on the video, and we initialise the next frame by the previous
facial bounding box. The classifier based on the multi-view
response maps is used as the failure checker during tracking.
The face detector will be called if the fitting fails. The MHM
takes 12.21 ms per face, and the classifier takes 2.32ms per
face. The proposed multi-view face alignment and tracking
method can run at about 50 FPS on the 300VW testset.
We compare our method against the winners of the 300VW
challenge: Yang et al. [75] and Xiao et al. [76]. Figure 15
reports the CED curves for all three video scenarios, and
Table III reports the AUC and Failure Rate measures. The
proposed MHM achieves the best performance, by a large
margin compared to the winner of the 300VW competition
(?15% at RMSE = 0.02 in Scenario1&2, ?10% at RMSE
= 0.02 in Scenario3) as well as the best setting for CFSS
method [23], [53] (?15% at RMSE = 0.02 in Scenario1&2,
?10% at RMSE = 0.02 in Scenario3), despite the fact that
our approach is not fine-tuned on the training set of 300VW,
while the rest of the methods were trained on video sequences
and sometimes even with temporal modelling. Besides, our
frame-by-frame tracking result is good enough that additional
smoothing step (Kalman Filter) might be unnecessary.
In Figure 14, we select some frames from most challenging
videos in Scenario3 and show their corresponding response
maps for visualisation purpose. The response maps of pro-
posed method is very robust under large pose variation (yaw
+ pitch angles) and occlusion. In addition, response maps of
invisible face parts are also reasonable, which indicates an
implicit facial shape constraint within our method.
E. Face Detection
We evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-view response
maps to remove high score false positives and obtain a state-
of-the-art result on the FDDB dataset. As in [9], we review
the annotation of FDDB [77], and add 67 unlabelled faces in
FDDB dataset to make sure all the false alarms are correct.
We enlarge FDDB images by 1.6, and the average resolution is
about 639×604. We test the model on a single NVIDIA GTX
Titan X (Pascal) GPU setting minimum face as 20. As shown
in Table IV and Figure 16(a), we observe the improvement of
recall within the high precision section (150 false positives,
precision rate 97.1%). The baseline method refers to our re-
implementation of MTCNN [54], due to adopting additional
labelled faces from AFLW, our implementation is slightly
better than the original MTCNN. Our method th1 sets a
higher thresholds (0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7) for cascaded classifiers,
while our method th2 employs a lower thresholds (0.5, 0.5,
0.3, 0.7). As can be seen from Table IV and Table V, the
setting of th2 is slightly better than th1, but increases the
running time from 49.8 ms to 62.9ms per image. The proposed
joint multi-view response maps contribute to removing high
score false positives from previous cascade classifiers. At
the precision rate of 99.9%, the proposed method improves

99%, the proposed method improves the recall from 89.9% to
90.5%. The result is obviously higher than HR-ER [78] and
Conv3D [79], and comparable with the best academic face
detectors, e.g. STN [9], Xiaomi [80], and DeepIR [81]. After
investigating our false positives, we surprisingly find some tiny
regions (shown in Figure 16(b)) that can hardly be removed
by our method, since they have very similar appearance and
structure of the face, and may only be resolved by context-
based model.

of-the-art method DenseBox, our joint multi-view response
maps achieve a significantly better detection result in large
pose data (yaw angle > 40 degrees). A similar improvement
could also be observed on the “hard” subsets.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a coarse-to-fine multi-view face
alignment method where a face detector is used to estimate
a coarse estimate of the facial shape using a small subset of
landmarks and then after removing similarity transformations
a refining subsequent step is performed that estimates the high-
resolution facial shape of each person. We formulate a novel
multi-view hourglass model which tries to jointly estimate
both semi-frontal and profile facial landmarks, and the joint
training model is stable and robust under continuous view
variations. We demonstrate huge improvement over the state-
of-the-art results in the latest benchmarks for face alignment
such as 300W, COFW and the latest Menpo Benchmark. We
also demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the deformable
face tracking on the 300VW benchmark and face detection
on FDDB and MALF datasets.
