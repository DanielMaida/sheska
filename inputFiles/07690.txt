Abstract
The centroid-based model for extractive
document summarization is a simple and
fast baseline that ranks sentences based on
their similarity to a centroid vector. In this
paper, we apply this ranking to possible
summaries instead of sentences and use a
simple greedy algorithm to find the best
summary. Furthermore, we show possi-
bilities to scale up to larger input docu-
ment collections by selecting a small num-
ber of sentences from each document prior
to constructing the summary. Experiments
were done on the DUC2004 dataset for
multi-document summarization. We ob-
serve a higher performance over the orig-
inal model, on par with more complex
state-of-the-art methods.
1 Introduction
Extractive multi-document summarization (MDS)
aims to summarize a collection of documents by
selecting a small number of sentences that repre-
sent the original content appropriately. Typical ob-
jectives for assembling a summary include infor-
mation coverage and non-redundancy. A wide va-
riety of methods have been introduced to approach
MDS.
Many approaches are based on sentence rank-
ing, i.e. assigning each sentence a score that in-
dicates how well the sentence summarizes the in-
put (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Hong and Nenkova,
2014; Cao et al., 2015). A summary is created by
selecting the top entries of the ranked list of sen-
tences. Since the sentences are often treated sepa-
rately, these models might allow redundancy in the
summary. Therefore, they are often extended by
an anti-redundancy filter while de-queuing ranked
sentence lists.
Other approaches work at summary-level rather
than sentence-level and aim to optimize functions
of sets of sentences to find good summaries, such
as KL-divergence between probability distribu-
tions (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) or sub-
modular functions that represent coverage, diver-
sity, etc. (Lin and Bilmes, 2011)
The centroid-based model belongs to the for-
mer group: it represents sentences as bag-of-word
(BOW) vectors with TF-IDF weighting and uses
a centroid of these vectors to represent the whole
document collection (Radev et al., 2004). The
sentences are ranked by their cosine similarity to
the centroid vector. This method is often found as
a baseline in evaluations where it usually is out-
performed (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Hong et al.,
2014).
This baseline can easily be adapted to work at
the summary-level instead the sentence level. This
is done by representing a summary as the centroid
of its sentence vectors and maximizing the simi-
larity between the summary centroid and the cen-
troid of the document collection. A simple greedy
algorithm is used to find the best summary under
a length constraint.
In order to keep the method efficient, we outline
different methods to select a small number of can-
didate sentences from each document in the input
collection before constructing the summary.
We test these modifications on the DUC2004
dataset for multi-document summarization. The
results show an improvement of Rouge scores over
the original centroid method. The performance is
on par with state-of-the-art methods which shows
that the similarity between a summary centroid
and the input centroid is a well-suited function for
global summary optimization.
The summarization approach presented in this
paper is fast, unsupervised and simple to imple-
ment. Nevertheless, it performs as well as more
complex state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
Rouge scores on the DUC2004 dataset. It can be
used as a strong baseline for future research or as
a fast and easy-to-deploy summarization tool.
2 Approach
2.1 Original Centroid-based Method
The original centroid-based model is described
by Radev et al. (2004). It represents sentences as
BOW vectors with TF-IDF weighting. The cen-
troid vector is the sum of all sentence vectors and
each sentence is scored by the cosine similarity
between its vector representation and the centroid
vector. Cosine similarity measures how close two
vectors A and B are based on their angle and is
defined as follows:
sim(A,B) =
A ·B
|A||B|
(1)
A summary is selected by de-queuing the ranked
list of sentences in decreasing order until the de-
sired summary length is reached.
Rossiello et al. (2017) implement this original
model with the following modifications:
1. In order to avoid redundant sentences in the
summary, a new sentence is only included if
it does not exceed a certain maximum sim-
ilarity to any of the already included sen-
tences.
2. To focus on only the most important terms of
the input documents, the values in the cen-
troid vector which fall below a tuned thresh-
old are set to zero.
This model, which includes the anti-redundancy
filter and the selection of top-ranking features, is
treated as the ”original” centroid-based model in
this paper.
We implement the selection of top-ranking fea-
tures for both the original and modified models
slightly differently to Rossiello et al. (2017): all
words in the vocabulary are ranked by their value
in the centroid vector. On a development dataset,
a parameter is tuned that defines the proportion of
the ranked vocabulary that is represented in the
centroid vector and the rest is set to zero. This
variant resulted in more stable behavior for differ-
ent amounts of input documents.
2.2 Modified Summary Selection
The similarity to the centroid vector can also be
used to score a summary instead of a sentence. By
representing a summary as the sum of its sentence
vectors, it can be compared to the centroid, which
is different from adding centroid-similarity scores
of individual sentences.
With this modification, the summarization task
is explicitly modelled as finding a combination of
sentences that summarize the input well together
instead of finding sentences that summarize the
input well independently. This strategy should
also be less dependent on anti-redundancy filter-
ing since a combination of redundant sentences is
probably less similar to the centroid than a more
diverse selection that covers different prevalent
topics.
In the experiments, we will therefore call this
modification the ”global” variant of the centroid
model. The same principle is used by the KL-
Sum model (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) in
which the optimal summary minimizes the KL-
divergence of the probability distribution of words
in the input from the distribution in the summary.
KLSum uses a greedy algorithm to find the best
summary. Starting with an empty summary, the
algorithm includes at each iteration the sentence
that maximizes the similarity to the centroid when
added to the already selected sentences. We also
use this algorithm for sentence selection. The pro-
cedure is depicted in Algorithm 1 below.
Algorithm 1 Greedy Sentence Selection
1: Input: input sentences D, centroid c, limit
2: Output: summary sentences S
3: S ? ?
4: length? 0
5: while length < limit and D 6= ? do
6: sbest ? arg max
s?D
sim(S ? {s}, c)
7: S ? S ? {sbest}
8: D ? D \ {sbest}
9: length? length+ 1
2.3 Preselection of Sentences
The modified sentence selection method is less ef-
ficient than the orginal method since at each iter-
ation the score of a possible summary has to be
computed for all remaining candidate sentences.
It may not be noticeable for a small number of in-
put sentences. However, it would have an impact
if the amount of input documents was larger, e.g.
for the summarization of top-100 search results in
document retrieval.
Therefore, we explore different methods for re-
ducing the number of input sentences before ap-
plying the greedy sentence selection algorithm to
make the model more suited for larger inputs. It is
also important to examine how this affects Rouge
scores.
We test the following methods of selecting N
sentences from each document as candidates for
the greedy sentence selection algorithm:
N-first
The first N sentences of the document are se-
lected. This results in a mixture of a lead-N base-
line and the centroid-based method.
N-best
The sentences are ranked separately in each docu-
ment by their cosine similarity to the centroid vec-
tor, in decreasing order. The N best sentences of
each document are selected as candidates.
New-TF-IDF
Each sentence is scored by the sum of the TF-IDF
scores of the terms that are mentioned in that sen-
tence for the first time in the document. The in-
tuition is that sentences are preferred if they intro-
duce new important information to a document.
Note that in each of these candidate selection
methods, the centroid vector is always computed
as the sum of all sentence vectors, including the
ones of the ignored sentences.
3 Experiments
Datasets
For testing, we use the DUC2004 Task 2 dataset
from the Document Understanding Conference
(DUC). The dataset consists of 50 document clus-
ters containing 10 documents each. For tun-
ing hyperparameters, we use the CNN/Daily Mail
dataset (Hermann et al., 2015) which provides
summary bulletpoints for individual news articles.
In order to adapt the dataset for MDS, 50 CNN ar-
ticles were randomly selected as documents to ini-
tialize 50 clusters. For each of these seed articles,
9 articles with the highest word-overlap in the first
3 sentences were added to that cluster. This re-
sulted in 50 documents clusters, each containing
10 topically related articles. The reference sum-
maries for each cluster were created by interleav-
ing the sentences of the article summaries until a
length contraint (100 words) was reached.
Baselines & Evaluation
Hong et al. (2014) published SumRepo, a reposi-
tory of summaries for the DUC2004 dataset gener-
ated by several baseline and state-of-the-art meth-
ods 1. We evaluate summaries generated by a se-
lection of these methods on the same data that we
use for testing. We calculate Rouge scores with
the Rouge toolkit (Lin, 2004). In order to compare
our results to Hong et al. (2014) we use the same
Rouge settings as they do2 and report results for
Rouge-1, Rouge-2 and Rouge-4 recall. The base-
lines include a basic centroid-based model without
an anti-redundancy filter and feature reduction.
Preprocessing
In the summarization methods proposed in this pa-
per, the preprocessing includes sentence segmen-
tation, lowercasing and stopword removal.
Parameter Tuning
The similarity threshold for avoiding redundancy
(r) and the vocabulary-included-in-centroid ratio
(v) are tuned with the original centroid model on
our development set. Values from 0 to 1 with step
size 0.1 were tested using a grid search. The op-
timal values for r and v were 0.6 and 0.1, respec-
tively. These values were used for all tested vari-
ants of the centroid model. For the different meth-
ods of choosing N sentences of each document
before summarization, we tuned N separately for
each, with values from 1 to 10, using the global
model. The best N found for N -first, N -best,
new-tfidf were 7, 2 and 3 respectively.

experiments. The first two sections show results

ants presented in this paper. ”G” indicates that
the global greedy algorithm was used instead of
sentence-level ranking. In the last section, ”- R”

Table 1: Rouge scores on DUC2004.
Both the global optimization and the sentence
preselection have a positive impact on the perfor-
mance.
The global + new-TF-IDF variant outperforms
all but the DPP model in Rouge-1 recall. The
global + N-first variant outperforms all other mod-
els in Rouge-2 recall. However, the Rouge scores
of the SOTA methods and the introduced centroid
variants are in a very similar range.
Interestingly, the original centroid-based model,
without any of the new modifications introduced
in this paper, already shows quite high Rouge
scores in comparison to the other baseline meth-
ods. This is due to the anti-redundancy filter and
the selection of top-ranking features.
In order to see whether the global sentence se-
lection alleviates the need for an anti-redundancy
filter, the original method and the global method
(without N sentences per document selection)
were tested without it (section 4 in Table 1). In
terms of Rouge-1 recall, the original model is
clearly very dependent on checking for redun-
dancy when including sentences, while the global
variant does not change its performance much
without the anti-redundancy filter. This matches
the expectation that the globally motivated method
handles redundancy implicitly.
4 Example Summaries
Table 2 shows generated example summaries us-
ing the global centroid method with the three sen-
tence preselection methods. For readability, trun-
cated sentences (due to the 100-word limit) at the
end of the summaries are excluded. The original
positions of the summary sentences, i.e. the in-
dices of the document and the sentence inside the
document are given. As can be seen in the exam-
ples, the N-first method is restricted to sentences
appearing early in documents. In the new-TF-
IDF example, the second and third sentences were
preselected because high ranking features such as
”robot” and ”arm” appeared for the first time in
the respective documents.
5 Related Work
In addition to various works on sophisticated mod-
els for multi-document summarization, other ex-
periments have been done showing that simple
modifications to the standard baseline methods
can perform quite well.
Rossiello et al. (2017) improved the centroid-
based method by representing sentences as sums
of word embeddings instead of TF-IDF vectors
so that semantic relationships between sentences
that have no words in common can be captured.
Mackie et al. (2016) also evaluated summaries
from SumRepo and did experiments on improv-
ing baseline systems such as the centroid-based
and the KL-divergence method with different anti-
redundancy filters. Their best optimized baseline
obtained a performance similar to the ICSI method
in SumRepo.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we show that simple modifications
to the centroid-based method can bring its perfor-
mance to the same level as state-of-the-art meth-
ods on the DUC2004 dataset. The resulting sum-
marization methods are unsupervised, efficient
and do not require complicated feature engineer-
ing or training.
Changing from a ranking-based method to
a global optimization method increases perfor-
mance and makes the summarizer less dependent
on explicitly checking for redundancy. This can be
useful for input document collections with differ-
ing levels of content diversity.

lead to additional improvements while reducing
computation effort, if global optimization is be-
ing used. These methods could be useful for other
summarization models that rely on pairwise sim-
ilarity computations between all input sentences,
or other properties which would slow down sum-
marization of large numbers of input sentences.
The modified methods can also be used as
strong baselines for future experiments in multi-
document summarization.
