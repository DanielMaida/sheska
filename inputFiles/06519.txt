Abstract
The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) in many real world applications is largely hindered
by their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose
a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1) re-
duce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory foot-
print; and 3) lower the number of computing operations,
without compromising accuracy. This is achieved by en-
forcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but
effective way. Different from many existing approaches, the
proposed method directly applies to modern CNN architec-
tures, introduces minimum overhead to the training process,
and requires no special software/hardware accelerators for
the resulting models. We call our approach network slim-
ming, which takes wide and large networks as input mod-
els, but during training insignificant channels are automat-
ically identified and pruned afterwards, yielding thin and
compact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several
state-of-the-art CNN models, including VGGNet, ResNet
and DenseNet, on various image classification datasets. For
VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a
20× reduction in model size and a 5× reduction in comput-
ing operations.
1. Introduction
In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have become the dominant approach for a variety of com-
puter vision tasks, e.g., image classification [22], object
detection [8], semantic segmentation [26]. Large-scale
datasets, high-end modern GPUs and new network architec-
tures allow the development of unprecedented large CNN
models. For instance, from AlexNet [22], VGGNet [31] and
GoogleNet [34] to ResNets [14], the ImageNet Classifica-
tion Challenge winner models have evolved from 8 layers
to more than 100 layers.
?This work was done when Zhuang Liu and Zhiqiang Shen were interns
at Intel Labs China. Jianguo Li is the corresponding author.
However, larger CNNs, although with stronger represen-
tation power, are more resource-hungry. For instance, a
152-layer ResNet [14] has more than 60 million parame-
ters and requires more than 20 Giga float-point-operations
(FLOPs) when inferencing an image with resolution 224×
224. This is unlikely to be affordable on resource con-
strained platforms such as mobile devices, wearables or In-
ternet of Things (IoT) devices.
The deployment of CNNs in real world applications are
mostly constrained by 1) Model size: CNNs’ strong repre-
sentation power comes from their millions of trainable pa-
rameters. Those parameters, along with network structure
information, need to be stored on disk and loaded into mem-
ory during inference time. As an example, storing a typi-
cal CNN trained on ImageNet consumes more than 300MB
space, which is a big resource burden to embedded devices.
2) Run-time memory: During inference time, the interme-
diate activations/responses of CNNs could even take more
memory space than storing the model parameters, even with
batch size 1. This is not a problem for high-end GPUs, but
unaffordable for many applications with low computational
power. 3) Number of computing operations: The convolu-
tion operations are computationally intensive on high reso-
lution images. A large CNN may take several minutes to
process one single image on a mobile device, making it un-
realistic to be adopted for real applications.
Many works have been proposed to compress large
CNNs or directly learn more efficient CNN models for fast
inference. These include low-rank approximation [7], net-
work quantization [3, 12] and binarization [28, 6], weight
pruning [12], dynamic inference [16], etc. However, most
of these methods can only address one or two challenges
mentioned above. Moreover, some of the techniques require
specially designed software/hardware accelerators for exe-
cution speedup [28, 6, 12].
Another direction to reduce the resource consumption of
large CNNs is to sparsify the network. Sparsity can be im-
posed on different level of structures [2, 37, 35, 29, 25],
which yields considerable model-size compression and in-
ference speedup. However, these approaches generally re-

pruning
Figure 1: We associate a scaling factor (reused from a batch normalization layer) with each channel in convolutional layers. Sparsity
regularization is imposed on these scaling factors during training to automatically identify unimportant channels. The channels with small
scaling factor values (in orange color) will be pruned (left side). After pruning, we obtain compact models (right side), which are then
fine-tuned to achieve comparable (or even higher) accuracy as normally trained full network.
quire special software/hardware accelerators to harvest the
gain in memory or time savings, though it is easier than
non-structured sparse weight matrix as in [12].
In this paper, we propose network slimming, a simple
yet effective network training scheme, which addresses all
the aforementioned challenges when deploying large CNNs
under limited resources. Our approach imposes L1 regular-
ization on the scaling factors in batch normalization (BN)
layers, thus it is easy to implement without introducing any
change to existing CNN architectures. Pushing the val-
ues of BN scaling factors towards zero with L1 regulariza-
tion enables us to identify insignificant channels (or neu-
rons), as each scaling factor corresponds to a specific con-
volutional channel (or a neuron in a fully-connected layer).
This facilitates the channel-level pruning at the followed
step. The additional regularization term rarely hurt the per-
formance. In fact, in some cases it leads to higher gen-
eralization accuracy. Pruning unimportant channels may
sometimes temporarily degrade the performance, but this
effect can be compensated by the followed fine-tuning of
the pruned network. After pruning, the resulting narrower
network is much more compact in terms of model size, run-
time memory, and computing operations compared to the
initial wide network. The above process can be repeated
for several times, yielding a multi-pass network slimming
scheme which leads to even more compact network.
Experiments on several benchmark datasets and different
network architectures show that we can obtain CNN models
with up to 20x mode-size compression and 5x reduction in
computing operations of the original ones, while achieving
the same or even higher accuracy. Moreover, our method
achieves model compression and inference speedup with
conventional hardware and deep learning software pack-
ages, since the resulting narrower model is free of any
sparse storing format or computing operations.
2. Related Work
In this section, we discuss related work from five aspects.
Low-rank Decomposition approximates weight matrix in
neural networks with low-rank matrix using techniques like
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [7]. This method
works especially well on fully-connected layers, yield-
ing ?3x model-size compression however without notable
speed acceleration, since computing operations in CNN
mainly come from convolutional layers.
Weight Quantization. HashNet [3] proposes to quantize
the network weights. Before training, network weights are
hashed to different groups and within each group weight
the value is shared. In this way only the shared weights and
hash indices need to be stored, thus a large amount of stor-
age space could be saved. [12] uses a improved quantization
technique in a deep compression pipeline and achieves 35x
to 49x compression rates on AlexNet and VGGNet. How-
ever, these techniques can neither save run-time memory
nor inference time, since during inference shared weights
need to be restored to their original positions.
[28, 6] quantize real-valued weights into binary/ternary
weights (weight values restricted to {?1, 1} or {?1, 0, 1}).
This yields a large amount of model-size saving, and signifi-
cant speedup could also be obtained given bitwise operation
libraries. However, this aggressive low-bit approximation
method usually comes with a moderate accuracy loss.
Weight Pruning / Sparsifying. [12] proposes to prune the
unimportant connections with small weights in trained neu-
ral networks. The resulting network’s weights are mostly
zeros thus the storage space can be reduced by storing the
model in a sparse format. However, these methods can only
achieve speedup with dedicated sparse matrix operation li-
braries and/or hardware. The run-time memory saving is
also very limited since most memory space is consumed by
the activation maps (still dense) instead of the weights.
In [12], there is no guidance for sparsity during training.
[32] overcomes this limitation by explicitly imposing sparse
constraint over each weight with additional gate variables,
and achieve high compression rates by pruning connections
with zero gate values. This method achieves better com-
pression rate than [12], but suffers from the same drawback.
Structured Pruning / Sparsifying. Recently, [23] pro-
poses to prune channels with small incoming weights in
trained CNNs, and then fine-tune the network to regain
accuracy. [2] introduces sparsity by random deactivat-
ing input-output channel-wise connections in convolutional
layers before training, which also yields smaller networks
with moderate accuracy loss. Compared with these works,
we explicitly impose channel-wise sparsity in the optimiza-
tion objective during training, leading to smoother channel
pruning process and little accuracy loss.
[37] imposes neuron-level sparsity during training thus
some neurons could be pruned to obtain compact networks.
[35] proposes a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method
to sparsify different level of structures (e.g. filters, channels
or layers) in CNNs. Both methods utilize group sparsity
regualarization during training to obtain structured spar-
sity. Instead of resorting to group sparsity on convolu-
tional weights, our approach imposes simple L1 sparsity on
channel-wise scaling factors, thus the optimization objec-
tive is much simpler.
Since these methods prune or sparsify part of the net-
work structures (e.g., neurons, channels) instead of individ-
ual weights, they usually require less specialized libraries
(e.g. for sparse computing operation) to achieve inference
speedup and run-time memory saving. Our network slim-
ming also falls into this category, with absolutely no special
libraries needed to obtain the benefits.
Neural Architecture Learning. While state-of-the-art
CNNs are typically designed by experts [22, 31, 14], there
are also some explorations on automatically learning net-
work architectures. [20] introduces sub-modular/super-
modular optimization for network architecture search with
a given resource budget. Some recent works [38, 1] propose
to learn neural architecture automatically with reinforce-
ment learning. The searching space of these methods are
extremely large, thus one needs to train hundreds of mod-
els to distinguish good from bad ones. Network slimming
can also be treated as an approach for architecture learning,
despite the choices are limited to the width of each layer.
However, in contrast to the aforementioned methods, net-
work slimming learns network architecture through only a
single training process, which is in line with our goal of
efficiency.
3. Network slimming
We aim to provide a simple scheme to achieve channel-
level sparsity in deep CNNs. In this section, we first dis-
cuss the advantages and challenges of channel-level spar-
sity, and introduce how we leverage the scaling layers in
batch normalization to effectively identify and prune unim-
portant channels in the network.
Advantages of Channel-level Sparsity. As discussed in
prior works [35, 23, 11], sparsity can be realized at differ-
ent levels, e.g., weight-level, kernel-level, channel-level or
layer-level. Fine-grained level (e.g., weight-level) sparsity
gives the highest flexibility and generality leads to higher
compression rate, but it usually requires special software or
hardware accelerators to do fast inference on the sparsified
model [11]. On the contrary, the coarsest layer-level spar-
sity does not require special packages to harvest the infer-
ence speedup, while it is less flexible as some whole layers
need to be pruned. In fact, removing layers is only effec-
tive when the depth is sufficiently large, e.g., more than 50
layers [35, 18]. In comparison, channel-level sparsity pro-
vides a nice tradeoff between flexibility and ease of imple-
mentation. It can be applied to any typical CNNs or fully-
connected networks (treat each neuron as a channel), and
the resulting network is essentially a “thinned” version of
the unpruned network, which can be efficiently inferenced
on conventional CNN platforms.
Challenges. Achieving channel-level sparsity requires
pruning all the incoming and outgoing connections asso-
ciated with a channel. This renders the method of directly
pruning weights on a pre-trained model ineffective, as it is
unlikely that all the weights at the input or output end of
a channel happen to have near zero values. As reported in
[23], pruning channels on pre-trained ResNets can only lead
to a reduction of?10% in the number of parameters without
suffering from accuracy loss. [35] addresses this problem
by enforcing sparsity regularization into the training objec-
tive. Specifically, they adopt group LASSO to push all the
filter weights corresponds to the same channel towards zero
simultaneously during training. However, this approach re-
quires computing the gradients of the additional regulariza-
tion term with respect to all the filter weights, which is non-
trivial. We introduce a simple idea to address the above
challenges, and the details are presented below.
Scaling Factors and Sparsity-induced Penalty. Our idea
is introducing a scaling factor ? for each channel, which is
multiplied to the output of that channel. Then we jointly
train the network weights and these scaling factors, with
sparsity regularization imposed on the latter. Finally we
prune those channels with small factors, and fine-tune the
pruned network. Specifically, the training objective of our
approach is given by
L =
?
(x,y)
l(f(x,W ), y) + ?
?
???
g(?) (1)
where (x, y) denote the train input and target, W denotes
the trainable weights, the first sum-term corresponds to the
normal training loss of a CNN, g(·) is a sparsity-induced
penalty on the scaling factors, and ? balances the two terms.
In our experiment, we choose g(s) = |s|, which is known as

L1-norm and widely used to achieve sparsity. Subgradient
descent is adopted as the optimization method for the non-
smooth L1 penalty term. An alternative option is to replace
the L1 penalty with the smooth-L1 penalty [30] to avoid
using sub-gradient at non-smooth point.
As pruning a channel essentially corresponds to remov-
ing all the incoming and outgoing connections of that chan-
nel, we can directly obtain a narrow network (see Figure 1)
without resorting to any special sparse computation pack-
ages. The scaling factors act as the agents for channel se-
lection. As they are jointly optimized with the network
weights, the network can automatically identity insignifi-
cant channels, which can be safely removed without greatly
affecting the generalization performance.
Leveraging the Scaling Factors in BN Layers. Batch nor-
malization [19] has been adopted by most modern CNNs
as a standard approach to achieve fast convergence and bet-
ter generalization performance. The way BN normalizes
the activations motivates us to design a simple and effi-
cient method to incorporates the channel-wise scaling fac-
tors. Particularly, BN layer normalizes the internal activa-
tions using mini-batch statistics. Let zin and zout be the
input and output of a BN layer, B denotes the current mini-
batch, BN layer performs the following transformation:
z? =
zin ? µB?
?2B + 
; zout = ?z? + ? (2)
where µB and ?B are the mean and standard deviation val-
ues of input activations over B, ? and ? are trainable affine
transformation parameters (scale and shift) which provides
the possibility of linearly transforming normalized activa-
tions back to any scales.
It is common practice to insert a BN layer after a convo-
lutional layer, with channel-wise scaling/shifting parame-
ters. Therefore, we can directly leverage the ? parameters in
BN layers as the scaling factors we need for network slim-
ming. It has the great advantage of introducing no overhead
to the network. In fact, this is perhaps also the most effec-
tive way we can learn meaningful scaling factors for chan-
nel pruning. 1), if we add scaling layers to a CNN without
BN layer, the value of the scaling factors are not meaning-
ful for evaluating the importance of a channel, because both
convolution layers and scaling layers are linear transforma-
tions. One can obtain the same results by decreasing the
scaling factor values while amplifying the weights in the
convolution layers. 2), if we insert a scaling layer before
a BN layer, the scaling effect of the scaling layer will be
completely canceled by the normalization process in BN.
3), if we insert scaling layer after BN layer, there are two
consecutive scaling factors for each channel.
Channel Pruning and Fine-tuning. After training under
channel-level sparsity-induced regularization, we obtain a
model in which many scaling factors are near zero (see Fig-
ure 1). Then we can prune channels with near-zero scaling
factors, by removing all their incoming and outgoing con-
nections and corresponding weights. We prune channels
with a global threshold across all layers, which is defined
as a certain percentile of all the scaling factor values. For
instance, we prune 70% channels with lower scaling factors
by choosing the percentile threshold as 70%. By doing so,
we obtain a more compact network with less parameters and
run-time memory, as well as less computing operations.
Pruning may temporarily lead to some accuracy loss,
when the pruning ratio is high. But this can be largely com-
pensated by the followed fine-tuning process on the pruned
network. In our experiments, the fine-tuned narrow network
can even achieve higher accuracy than the original unpruned
network in many cases.
Multi-pass Scheme. We can also extend the proposed
method from single-pass learning scheme (training with
sparsity regularization, pruning, and fine-tuning) to a multi-
pass scheme. Specifically, a network slimming procedure
results in a narrow network, on which we could again apply
the whole training procedure to learn an even more compact
model. This is illustrated by the dotted-line in Figure 2. Ex-
perimental results show that this multi-pass scheme can lead
to even better results in terms of compression rate.
Handling Cross Layer Connections and Pre-activation
Structure. The network slimming process introduced
above can be directly applied to most plain CNN architec-
tures such as AlexNet [22] and VGGNet [31]. While some
adaptations are required when it is applied to modern net-
works with cross layer connections and the pre-activation
design such as ResNet [15] and DenseNet [17]. For these
networks, the output of a layer may be treated as the input
of multiple subsequent layers, in which a BN layer is placed
before the convolutional layer. In this case, the sparsity is
achieved at the incoming end of a layer, i.e., the layer selec-
tively uses a subset of channels it received. To harvest the
parameter and computation savings at test time, we need
to place a channel selection layer to mask out insignificant
channels we have identified.
4. Experiments
We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of network
slimming on several benchmark datasets. We implement

plementation for ResNets by [10]. The code is available at

4.1. Datasets
CIFAR. The two CIFAR datasets [21] consist of natural im-
ages with resolution 32×32. CIFAR-10 is drawn from 10
and CIFAR-100 from 100 classes. The train and test sets
contain 50,000 and 10,000 images respectively. On CIFAR-
10, a validation set of 5,000 images is split from the training
set for the search of ? (in Equation 1) on each model. We
report the final test errors after training or fine-tuning on
all training images. A standard data augmentation scheme
(shifting/mirroring) [14, 18, 24] is adopted. The input data
is normalized using channel means and standard deviations.
We also compare our method with [23] on CIFAR datasets.
SVHN. The Street View House Number (SVHN) dataset
[27] consists of 32x32 colored digit images. Following
common practice [9, 18, 24] we use all the 604,388 training
images, from which we split a validation set of 6,000 im-
ages for model selection during training. The test set con-
tains 26,032 images. During training, we select the model
with the lowest validation error as the model to be pruned
(or the baseline model). We also report the test errors of the
models with lowest validation errors during fine-tuning.
ImageNet. The ImageNet dataset contains 1.2 million
training images and 50,000 validation images of 1000
classes. We adopt the data augmentation scheme as in [10].
We report the single-center-crop validation error of the final
model.
MNIST. MNIST is a handwritten digit dataset containing
60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. To test the
effectiveness of our method on a fully-connected network
(treating each neuron as a channel with 1×1 spatial size),
we compare our method with [35] on this dataset.
4.2. Network Models
On CIFAR and SVHN dataset, we evaluate our method
on three popular network architectures: VGGNet[31],
ResNet [14] and DenseNet [17]. The VGGNet is originally
designed for ImageNet classification. For our experiment a
variation of the original VGGNet for CIFAR dataset is taken
from [36]. For ResNet, a 164-layer pre-activation ResNet
with bottleneck structure (ResNet-164) [15] is used. For
DenseNet, we use a 40-layer DenseNet with growth rate 12
(DenseNet-40).
On ImageNet dataset, we adopt the 11-layer (8-conv +
3 FC) “VGG-A” network [31] model with batch normaliza-
tion from [4]. We remove the dropout layers since we use
relatively heavy data augmentation. To prune the neurons
in fully-connected layers, we treat them as convolutional
channels with 1×1 spatial size.
On MNIST dataset, we evaluate our method on the same
3-layer fully-connected network as in [35].
4.3. Training, Pruning and Fine-tuning
Normal Training. We train all the networks normally from
scratch as baselines. All the networks are trained using
SGD. On CIFAR and SVHN datasets we train using mini-
batch size 64 for 160 and 20 epochs, respectively. The ini-
tial learning rate is set to 0.1, and is divided by 10 at 50%
and 75% of the total number of training epochs. On Im-
ageNet and MNIST datasets, we train our models for 60
and 30 epochs respectively, with a batch size of 256, and an
initial learning rate of 0.1 which is divided by 10 after 1/3
and 2/3 fraction of training epochs. We use a weight de-
cay of 10?4 and a Nesterov momentum [33] of 0.9 without
dampening. The weight initialization introduced by [13] is
adopted. Our optimization settings closely follow the orig-
inal implementation at [10]. In all our experiments, we ini-
tialize all channel scaling factors to be 0.5, since this gives
higher accuracy for the baseline models compared with de-
fault setting (all initialized to be 1) from [10].
Training with Sparsity. For CIFAR and SVHN datasets,
when training with channel sparse regularization, the hyper-
parameteer ?, which controls the tradeoff between empiri-
cal loss and sparsity, is determined by a grid search over
10?3, 10?4, 10?5 on CIFAR-10 validation set. For VG-
GNet we choose ?=10?4 and for ResNet and DenseNet
?=10?5. For VGG-A on ImageNet, we set ?=10?5. All
other settings are kept the same as in normal training.
Pruning. When we prune the channels of models trained
with sparsity, a pruning threshold on the scaling factors
needs to be determined. Unlike in [23] where different lay-
ers are pruned by different ratios, we use a global pruning
threshold for simplicity. The pruning threshold is deter-
mined by a percentile among all scaling factors , e.g., 40%
or 60% channels are pruned. The pruning process is imple-

Fine-tuning. After the pruning we obtain a narrower and
more compact model, which is then fine-tuned. On CIFAR,
SVHN and MNIST datasets, the fine-tuning uses the same
optimization setting as in training. For ImageNet dataset,
due to time constraint, we fine-tune the pruned VGG-A with
a learning rate of 10?3 for only 5 epochs.
4.4. Results
CIFAR and SVHN The results on CIFAR and SVHN are
shown in Table 1. We mark all lowest test errors of a model
in boldface.
Parameter and FLOP reductions. The purpose of net-
work slimming is to reduce the amount of computing re-
sources needed. The last row of each model has ? 60%
channels pruned while still maintaining similar accuracy to
the baseline. The parameter saving can be up to 10×. The
FLOP reductions are typically around 50%. To highlight
network slimming’s efficiency, we plot the resource sav-
ings in Figure 3. It can be observed that VGGNet has a
large amount of redundant parameters that can be pruned.
On ResNet-164 the parameter and FLOP savings are rel-
atively insignificant, we conjecture this is due to its “bot-
tleneck” structure has already functioned as selecting chan-
nels. Also, on CIFAR-100 the reduction rate is typically
slightly lower than CIFAR-10 and SVHN, which is possi-
bly due to the fact that CIFAR-100 contains more classes.
Regularization Effect. From Table 1, we can observe that,
on ResNet and DenseNet, typically when 40% channels are
pruned, the fine-tuned network can achieve a lower test er-
ror than the original models. For example, DenseNet-40
with 40% channels pruned achieve a test error of 5.19%
on CIFAR-10, which is almost 1% lower than the original
model. We hypothesize this is due to the regularization ef-
fect of L1 sparsity on channels, which naturally provides
feature selection in intermediate layers of a network. We
will analyze this effect in the next section.

ImageNet. The results for ImageNet dataset are summa-
rized in Table 2. When 50% channels are pruned, the pa-
rameter saving is more than 5×, while the FLOP saving
is only 30.4%. This is due to the fact that only 378 (out
of 2752) channels from all the computation-intensive con-
volutional layers are pruned, while 5094 neurons (out of
8192) from the parameter-intensive fully-connected layers
are pruned. It is worth noting that our method can achieve
the savings with no accuracy loss on the 1000-class Im-
ageNet dataset, where other methods for efficient CNNs
[2, 23, 35, 28] mostly report accuracy loss.
MNIST. On MNIST dataset, we compare our method with
the Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method [35] in Ta-
ble 3. Despite our method is mainly designed to prune
channels in convolutional layers, it also works well in prun-
ing neurons in fully-connected layers. In this experiment,
we observe that pruning with a global threshold sometimes
completely removes a layer, thus we prune 80% of the neu-
rons in each of the two intermediate layers. Our method
slightly outperforms [35], in that a slightly lower test error
is achieved while pruning more parameters.
We provide some additional experimental results in the
supplementary materials, including (1) detailed structure of
a compact VGGNet on CIFAR-10; (2) wall-clock time and
run-time memory savings in practice. (3) comparison with

4.5. Results for Multi-pass Scheme
We employ the multi-pass scheme on CIFAR datasets
using VGGNet. Since there are no skip-connections, prun-
ing away a whole layer will completely destroy the mod-
els. Thus, besides setting the percentile threshold as 50%,
we also put a constraint that at each layer, at most 50% of
channels can be pruned.
The test errors of models in each iteration are shown in
Table 4. As the pruning process goes, we obtain more and

6.34% and 26.74%. “Trained” and “Fine-tuned” columns denote
the test errors (%) of the model trained with sparsity, and the fine-
tuned model after channel pruning, respectively. The parameter
and FLOP pruned ratios correspond to the fine-tuned model in that

more compact models. On CIFAR-10, the trained model
achieves the lowest test error in iteration 5. This model
achieves 20× parameter reduction and 5× FLOP reduction,
while still achieving lower test error. On CIFAR-100, after
iteration 3, the test error begins to increase. This is pos-
sibly due to that it contains more classes than CIFAR-10,
so pruning channels too agressively will inevitably hurt the
performance. However, we can still prune near 90% param-
eters and near 70% FLOPs without notable accuracy loss.
5. Analysis
There are two crucial hyper-parameters in network slim-
ming, the pruned percentage t and the coefficient of the
sparsity regularization term ? (see Equation 1). In this sec-
tion, we analyze their effects in more detail.
Effect of Pruned Percentage. Once we obtain a model
trained with sparsity regularization, we need to decide what
percentage of channels to prune from the model. If we
prune too few channels, the resource saving can be very
limited. However, it could be destructive to the model if
we prune too many channels, and it may not be possible to
recover the accuracy by fine-tuning. We train a DenseNet-
40 model with ?=10?5 on CIFAR-10 to show the effect of
pruning a varying percentage of channels. The results are
summarized in Figure 5.
From Figure 5, it can be concluded that the classification
performance of the pruned or fine-tuned models degrade
only when the pruning ratio surpasses a threshold. The fine-

tuning process can typically compensate the possible accu-
racy loss caused by pruning. Only when the threshold goes
beyond 80%, the test error of fine-tuned model falls behind
the baseline model. Notably, when trained with sparsity,
even without fine-tuning, the model performs better than the
original model. This is possibly due the the regularization
effect of L1 sparsity on channel scaling factors.
Channel Sparsity Regularization. The purpose of the L1
sparsity term is to force many of the scaling factors to be
near zero. The parameter ? in Equation 1 controls its signif-
icance compared with the normal training loss. In Figure 4
we plot the distributions of scaling factors in the whole net-
work with different ? values. For this experiment we use a
VGGNet trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.
It can be observed that with the increase of ?, the scaling
factors are more and more concentrated near zero. When
?=0, i.e., there’s no sparsity regularization, the distribution
is relatively flat. When ?=10?4, almost all scaling factors
fall into a small region near zero. This process can be seen
as a feature selection happening in intermediate layers of
deep networks, where only channels with non-negligible
scaling factors are chosen. We further visualize this pro-
cess by a heatmap. Figure 6 shows the magnitude of scaling
factors from one layer in VGGNet, along the training pro-
cess. Each channel starts with equal weights; as the training

progresses, some channels’ scaling factors become larger
(brighter) while others become smaller (darker).
6. Conclusion
We proposed the network slimming technique to learn
more compact CNNs. It directly imposes sparsity-induced
regularization on the scaling factors in batch normalization
layers, and unimportant channels can thus be automatically
identified during training and then pruned. On multiple
datasets, we have shown that the proposed method is able to
significantly decrease the computational cost (up to 20×) of
state-of-the-art networks, with no accuracy loss. More im-
portantly, the proposed method simultaneously reduces the
model size, run-time memory, computing operations while
introducing minimum overhead to the training process, and
the resulting models require no special libraries/hardware
for efficient inference.

B. Wall-clock Time and Run-time Memory
Savings
We test the wall-clock speed and memory footprint of a
“70% pruned” VGGNet (Table 1 (a)) on CIFAR-10 during
inference time. The experiment is conducted using Torch
[5] on a NVIDIA GeForce 1080 GPU with batch size 64.
The result is shown in Table 6.
The wall-clock time saving of this model roughly
matches the FLOP saving shown in Table 1 (a), despite the
memory saving is not as significant. This is due to the fact

that deeper layers, which have smaller activation maps and
occupy less memory, tend to have more channels pruned, as
shown by Table 5. Note that all savings require no special
libraries/hardware.
C. Comparison with [23]
On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we compare our
method with a previous channel pruning technique [23].
Unlike network slimming which prunes channels with a
global pruning threshold, [23] prunes different pre-defined
portion of channels at different layers. To make a compar-
ison, we adopt the pruning criterion introduced in [23] and
closely follow the per-layer pruning strategy of [23] on VG-
GNet [36]. The result is shown in Table 7. Compared with
[23], network slimming yields significantly lower test error
with a similar compression rate.
