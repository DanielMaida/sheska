A wavelet frame coefficient total variational
model for image restoration
Wei Wang?, Xiang-Gen Xia?†, and Shengli Zhang?
August 28, 2017
Abstract
In this paper, we propose a Rudin-Osher-Fatemi(ROF)-like model for
image restoration which utilizes total variation (TV) regularization on the
wavelet feature images. The model imposes more smoothing power on the
cartoon image generated by the low-pass filter and less strength on the
edges generated by the high-pass filters. Thus, the model can preserve
more edges and details than the ROF model. Next, the existence of
solution for the model was proved and a slightly modified split Bregman
algorithm was used to solve it. At last, we present some experimental
results to show its competitive advantage to the related methods both in
quality and efficiency.

1 Introduction
Image restoration including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting etc. is a
procedure of improving the quality of a given image that is degraded in various
ways during the process of acquisition and commutation; and enabling us to
obtain crucial but imperceptible information existing in the image. Since many
advanced applications in computer vision depend heavily on the input of high
quality images, image restoration becomes an indispensable and preprocessing
step of these applications. Therefore, image restoration is a basic but very
important area in image processing and analysis. Image restoration can be
modeled as a linear inverse problem:

where f is the observed images, A is a linear operator representing the blur
(usually a convolution) and ? represents the additive noise whose type depends
on its probability density function (PDF). The goal of image restoration is
to find the unknown true image u from the observed image f . The problem
is usually an ill-posed inverse problem and often solved by imposing a prior
regularization assumption. Among all regularization-based methods for image
restoration, variational based and wavelet frames based methods have attracted
a lot of attention in the past.
The common assumption of the regularization based methods is that images
can be sparsely approximated in some transformed domains. Such transforms
can be gradient operator, wavelet frame transform, Fourier transform, Gabor
transform etc. In order to utilize the sparsity, one solves (1) by finding a sparse
solution in the corresponding transformed domain. Typically, the l1 norm is
used as a penalty of the sparsity. One of the famous variational approaches is
the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model, which imposes the total variation (TV)
regularization on the image u:

.
Here, ? is the image domian, BV (?) is the bounded variational space,

and

dx are the TV (regularization) term and fidelity (fitting) term,
respectively. The ROF model performs well for removing noise while preserving
edges. However, it tends to produce piecewise constant results (called stair-
case effect in the literature). After the ROF model was proposed, the TV
regularization has been extended to many other image restoration applications
(such as deblurring, inpainting, superresolution, etc.) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]and has
been modified in a variety of ways to improve its performance [8][9][10][11].To
solve the ROF model, many algorithms have been proposed [12][13][14][15][16]
[17][18]and the split Bregman method is the one of the most widely used [16].
Wavelet frames represent images as a summarization of smooth components
(i.e. cartoon), and local features (i.e. singularities). In wavelet frame domain,
smooth image components are the coefficient images obtained from low-pass
filters, while local features are those obtained from high-pass filters. Thus, we
can impose different strength of regularization on smooth components and local
features separately when restoring images in the wavelet frame transform do-
mains. There exist plenty of wavelet frame based image restoration models in
the literature, such as, the synthesis based approach [19][20][21][22], the anal-
ysis based approach [23][24][25][26], and the balanced approach [27][28][29]. A
typical analysis based model of l1 norm regularization has a similar form with
the ROF model:

?Au? f?22 ,
where W represents the wavelet frame transform. Since the l1 norm regular-
izations usually exist in the wavelet frame based models, the split Bregman
algorithm is also a widely used method to solve them.

In this paper, we propose a ROF-like model for image restoration by com-
bining the TV regularization and wavelet frame based models. Unlike the ROF
model and the traditional wavelet frame based models, we impose the TV reg-
ularization on the coefficient images rather than the TV norm or the l1 norm.
In addition, the proposed model imposes more smoothing power on the cartoon
coefficient generated by the low-pass filter and less strength on the edges and
details coefficients generated by the high-pass filters. By this way, our model
can preserve more edges and details than the ROF model which imposes the
same smoothing power on all the spatial pixels. At last, the split Bregman algo-
rithm is used to solve the model and some numerical simulations are presented
to show the superiority of our method to the related models.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2.1, we describe
the proposed model and prove the existence of its solution. In Section 2.2, we
use the split Bregamn algorithm to solve the model. In Section 3, we present
some experimental results to show the advantage of our model. In Section 4,
we conclude this paper.
2 The wavelet coefficient total variational model
2.1 Proposed model
Before describing the model, we briefly introduce the discrete wavelet transform.
Note that in the literature, there are two kinds of wavelet transforms: decimated
and undecimated. Since every level coefficient (feature) images generated by the
undecimated wavelet transforms have the same size of the original, which is more
natural to our model, we adopt the undecimated version in this paper.
Define the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform, or the analysis oper-
ator with L levels of decomposition as
Wu = {Wl,m,nu : l = 0, 1, ...L? 1;m,n = 0, 1, ...r},
where
Wl,m,nu = (h
l
m)
Thln ? (hl?10 )Thl?10 ? (hl?20 )Thl?20 ...? (h10)Th10 ? u, (1)
? represents the matrix convolution and hlm is the row vector obtained by
inserting zeros into the analysis filter hm with factor 2
l.
The inverse (synthesis) wavelet transform is denoted as S. By the unitary
extension principle (UEP) in [30], we have S = W ?, where W ? is the adjoin
operator of W . Hence
W ?Wu = u (2)
The wavelet transform decomposes the image into different feature images
based on the different filters. The one generated by the low-pass filter is the
cartoon and those by the high pass-filters are the edges and details (see figure
3). When an image is corrupted by noises, all its feature images are contam-
inated. In this paper, we propose a variational model for image restoration
3
which imposes TV regularization on the wavelet feature images. In addition,
the proposed model imposes more smoothing power on the cartoon image gen-
erated by the low-pass filter and less strength on the edges and details generated
by the high-pass filters. By this way, our model can preserve more edges and
details than the ROF model which imposes the same smoothing power on all
the spatial pixels.
The proposed model is described as following:
argmin
u?BV (?)
E(u) =
?
?
?
?(~? ·Wu)
?

?Au? f?22 (3)
where W denotes the wavelet transform, (~? ·Wu)l,m,n = ?l,m,nWl,m,nu and ?
is the gradient operator. In this paper, we set all the value of ?l,m,n = ?1 > 0
equally except for ?L,0,0 = ?0 > ?1.
If W = 1, we have that problem (11) is reduced to the TV model. If the
frame is orthonormal, then E(u) can be rewritten as
?
j
?
??(?j · u?j)
?
?

?
?
?
(Au)?j ? f?j
?

and problem (3) is equivalent to the following problem:
argmin
u?j?BV (?)
E(u?j) =
?
??(?j · u?j )
?
?
1
+

?
?

(Au)?j ? f?j
?

(4)
where u?j =< u,?j > is the wavelet coefficient of frame basis ?j . Clearly,
problem (4) is the total variational model for every coefficient image u?j . Thus,
when the wavelet frame is orthonormal, the proposed model is equivalent to
denoising the feature images first and then synthesizing the final clean image.
In the literature, there are some papers [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] uti-
lizing the similar ideas. However, our model is different form them. Since the
redundant wavelet frames are not orthonormal, our model is not fully equivalent
to (4) and can only be seen as a ROF-like model using a different regulariza-
tion term. Moreover, most of the above papers tackle images in the transform
domain and obtain the restored images by the inverse wavelet transform while
our model is solved directly in the spatial domain.
In the following, we show the existence of the solution for problem (3).
Theorem 1. If the operators W , W ? and A are linear and bounded, ||A ?
1||L2(?) 6= 0, where ? is the convolution and ? is the image domian, then
problem (3) admits a solution in BV (?).
Proof. Let {un} be a minimizing sequence of problem (3). Then there exists a
constant M > 0 such that E(un) ? M , i.e.
?
?
?
?(~? ·Wun)
?
?

from which we get

?Aun ? f?22 ? M (6)
and

?(~? ·Wun)

? M (7)
Let ?W ??1 ? C. Then from inequality (7), we obtain

?
?
?

? ?W ??1
?
?
?
?(~? ·Wun)

? CM (8)
Since the operators ?, W can be seen as convolutions, they can interchange
orders. Thus by inequality (8), we have
?1 ??un? ? ?1 ?W ?W?un? = ?W ??(?1Wun)? ?
?
?
?
W ??(~? ·Wun)
?
?
?

? CM
(9)
which implies that the total variation of {un} is uniformly bounded.
From inequality (6) and ||A?1||L2(?) 6= 0, we can get that the sequence {un}
is bounded in L2(?) which was proved in [41]. Hence un is bounded in L
1(?).
Since the total variation of {un} is also bounded, we get that un is bounded
in BV (?). Therefore, there exists u? ? BV (?) such that un converges to u?
weakly in L2(?) and strongly in L1(?). Since the operatorW is linear bounded,
we have Wun converges to Wu
? weakly in L2(?) and strongly in L1(?). Then
a standard process can show that u? is a minimizer of E(u).
2.2 Algorithm
In this section, we utilize the split Bregman algorithm [16] to solve problem (3).
Let d = ?(Wu), d0 = b0 = 0, then problem (3) is equivalent to the following
iterations:
for j=0,1,2,
uj+1 = argmin

(11)
bj+1 = bj + (?(Wuj+1)? dj+1) (12)
Here, like ?, we set the value of ?l,m,n = ?1 > 0 equally except for ?L,0,0 = ?0 >
?1. The reason for the slight modification is that we want to smooth the feature
images generated by the low-pass filter h0
Th0 to a higher degree.

By (1) and (2), the KKT condition for problem (10) is
A?(Au? f) +W ???(~? · (?(Wu)? dj + bj))

where Al = (h
l
0)
Thl0, Bl = (g
l
0)
T gl0 and g
l
0 is the row vector obtained by inserting
zeros into the synthesis filter g0 with factor 2
l. Therefore, the solution for
problem (10) is
uj+1 = FFT?1(
FFT (??W ?(~? · (dj ? bj)) +A?f)
FFT (A?A+ ?1???+ (?0 ? ?1)???(A0...AL?1B0...BL?1))
)
(13)
Figure 1: From left to right, from up to down are: FFTs of ??? and
A0.AL?1B0.BL?1 with L = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively.
In Figure 1, we show the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of ??? and
A0...AL?1B0...BL?1 with different L, where h0 = g0 = [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]. From
Figure 1, we can see that when L > 2, the FFT of A0...AL?1B0...BL?1 is almost
zero. Also, we can observe that the effect of the term A0...AL?1B0...BL?1 is
opposite to that of ???. Since the effect of ??? is smoothing the image, the
6
term A0A1...AL?1B0B1...BL?1 may slow down the convergence speed and cause
artifacts in the denoised images. Thus in the numerical simulations, we neglect
the term???(A0...AL?1B0...BL?1) for computational efficiency. Equation (13)
is thus changed into
uj+1 = FFT?1(
FFT (??W ?(~? · (dj ? bj)) +A?f)
FFT (A?A+ ?1???)
) (14)
Equation (14) can be seen as a analogy of the original split Bregman algorithm
who solves uj+1 by
uj+1 = FFT?1(
FFT (??(?1 · (dj ? bj)) +A?f)
FFT (A?A+ ?1???)
)
By experiments, we find that using equation (14) can indeed get better results
and make the algorithm converge faster than using equation (13).
The solution for problem (11) is
dj+1 = TH(?(Wuj+1) + bj, ~?/~?) (15)
where TH(x, T ) = sgn(x)max(|x| ? T, 0).
At last, the algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1 below:
Algorithm 1

the tolerant error tol > 0.

Update uj+1, dj+1 and bj+1 by equations (14), (15) and (12), respectively.

3 Experimental results
In this section, we conduct some numerical experiments on image denoising
and image deblurring using Algorithm 1. In all of the numerical simulations,
the piecewise linear B-spline wavelet frame is used for W and the level of de-
compositions is set as L = 1. The filter banks of the B-spline wavelet frame
are
[h0(?1), h0(0), h0(1)] =

[1, 2, 1]

In Section 3.1, we compare the experimental results of our model with the related
methods (such as split Bregman algorithm (SB) [16], dual tree complex wavelet
transform (DTCWT) [42], local contextual hidden markov model (LHMM) [26]
and the lo minimization in wavelet frame based model ( lo-WF) [43]. In Sec-
tion 3.2, we perform the comparison on the simulation of image debluring with
our model, the lo-WF model and the EDWF[44] model. For measuring the im-
age quality quantitatively, we use the index peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR)
defined by
PSNR := 10log10(
255 ? 255 ?N
?ref ? u??22
)
where ref and u? are the true image and recovered image, respectively.
3.1 Image denoising
In this subsection, we compare the performances of our model with the SB,
DTCWT, LHMM and lo-WF on image denoising. Six images (all of size 256*256)
shown in Figure 2 are tested. The noisy images are generated by the MATLAB
command ‘imnoise’ with ‘type=Guassian’, m = 0 and variance v = 0.01.
In the implementation of image denoising, the parameters of our model are
set as: ?0 = 12, ?1 = 4.5, ?0 = 2, ?1 = 1.5, tol = 5e? 4. For the SB algorithm,
the parameters are set as: ? = 19, gamma = 1, tol = 5e? 4. For the DTCWT,
the decomposition level L = 4, threshold T = 20. For the lo-WF, the piecewise
linear B-spline wavelet frame is also used and the decomposition level L = 1,
? = 350, µ = 1, ? = 0.2, tol = 5e? 4.
In Figure 3, we show the feature (coefficient) images of a noisy image and
its denoised version by our method. From Figure 3, we can see that the noises
in every feature images are all removed.
In Figure 4 - Figure 6, we show the visual comparisons of the results from the
four compared methods. From the results of SB, we can see that the recovered
images have a lot of artifacts in the homogeneous regions. The reason is that
the regularization parameter ? is chosen optimal for PSNR value. In order
to preserve the sharp edges in images, a relatively small ? should be chosen.
However, it leads to lack of smoothness in homogeneous regions. This visual
effect is especially clear in the ‘cameraman’ image (see the sky and grass).
From the results of DTCWT and LCHMM, we can observe that the restored
images introduce too much artifacts. one of the reasons is that they both use
the decimated wavelet transform. From the last two results, we can see that
the denoised images by the lo-WF and ours have similar visual effects, but our

method has a slightly higher PSNR and less runtime averagely which can be
seen in Table 1.
Table 1 lists the PSNR and total run-time of the compared five methods
for image denoising. Since the LCHMM is coded by C++ and the others by
matlab, we don’t list the runtime of LCHMM. From Table 1, we can see that
our model outperforms the other image restoration methods in terms of PSNR,
averagely. In addition, from Table 1, we can see that the DTCWT is the fastest
(It spends less than 1 second for the six test images). However, the quality of
the DTCWT is the worst. The PSNR of our model is about 1.4db higher than
the DTCWT averagely.
To show the convergence of the modified split Bregman algorithm , we plot
the relative error ||u
n+1?un||
||un|| versus the iterations of the six test images in Figure
7. From Figure 7, we can observe the relative error is monotonically decreasing
with the iterations, which numerically proves that the algorithm is convergent.

3.2 Image debluring
In this subsection, we apply the proposed model to image deblurring and com-
pare the results with those of the lo-WF and EDWF. We also test the same
six images for image deblurring. The blurred images are generated by convo-
lution with the blur kernel A and added by a Gaussian noise ?, where A and
? are generated by the MATLAB command ‘A = fspecial(?motion?, 9, 0) ’ and
‘? = 5 ? randn(size(u)) ’, respectively.
In the implementation of image deblurring, the parameters of our model are
set as: ?0 = 0.4, ?1 = 0.1, ?0 = 0.004, ?1 = 0.002, tol = 5e? 4. For the lo-WF,
the piecewise linear B-spline wavelet frame is also used and the decomposition
level L = 1, ? = 30, µ = 0.01, ? = 0.003, tol = 5e ? 4. For the EDWF,
? = 1, ? = 1.5, ? = 0.2, v = 0.15, µ1 = 1, µ2 = 1.
In Figure 8, the visual results of the three models are presented and Table 2,
summarizes the PSNR and total run-time of the three methods. From Table 2,
we can see that the PSNR of our model is averagely the largest among the three
methods. We can also observe from Table 2 that the run-time of our model is
much less than the other two methods.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a wavelet frame coefficient total variational model
for image restoration and proved the existence of the solution of the model. A
slightly modified split Bregman algorithm was used to solve the model. At last,
we presented some experimental results to show its competitive advantage to
the related methods both in quality and efficiency.
