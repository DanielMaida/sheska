Segmentation of retinal cysts from Optical
Coherence Tomography volumes via selective
enhancement
Karthik Gopinath?, Jayanthi Sivaswamy, Member, IEEE
Abstract—Automated and accurate segmentation of cystoid
structures in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is of interest
in the early detection of retinal diseases. It is however a
challenging task. We propose a novel method for localizing
cysts in 3D OCT volumes. The proposed work is biologically
inspired and based on selective enhancement of the cysts, by
inducing motion to a given OCT slice. A Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) is designed to learn a mapping function that
combines the result of multiple such motions to produce a
probability map for cyst locations in a given slice. The final
segmentation of cysts is obtained via simple clustering of the
detected cyst locations. The proposed method is evaluated on
two public datasets and one private dataset. The public datasets
include the one released for the OPTIMA Cyst segmentation
challenge (OCSC) in MICCAI 2015 and the DME dataset. After
training on the OCSC train set, the method achieves a mean Dice
Coefficient (DC) of 0.71 on the OCSC test set. The robustness of
the algorithm was examined by cross validation on the DME and
AEI (private) datasets and a mean DC values obtained were 0.69
and 0.79, respectively. Overall, the proposed system outperforms
all benchmarks. These results underscore the strengths of the
proposed method in handling variations in both data acquisition
protocols and scanners.

I. INTRODUCTION
OPTICAL Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imagingmodality useful for assessing morphological changes in
the sub-retinal layers. Low image quality and high acquisition
time hindered the use of OCT in the early days. The newer
Spectral-Domain OCT (SD-OCT) overcomes these problems
and aids the assessment of small pathological changes. SD-
OCT scans can be obtained from multiple vendors at varying
resolutions and scanning patterns. Inter scanner variability is
reflected in terms of intensity variation and SNR. Automated
detection however has a few challenges: a)Inter-scanner and
intra-scanner variability in images (voxel intensities), b) noisy
images, c) ambiguous demarcation between sub-retinal layers
and finally d) variable shape, size, appearance and arbitrary
locations of cysts in the images. Early work on SD-OCT image
analysis focused on the intra-retinal tissue layer segmentation
[1] [2] [3] whereas attention to abnormality (such as cyst)

detection is very recent, with cyst segmentation being posed
as a challenge problem in MICCAI 2015. Cystoid Macular
Edema (CME) is a condition in which fluid filled regions
(cysts) are formed in the macula leading to swelling [4] [5].
It is a common retinal disorder that co-occurs in a variety
of conditions. If CME is left untreated for more than 6 to 9
months it can lead to chronic macular changes with permanent
impairment of central vision. Therefore, the automated detec-
tion of CME from SD-OCT images is of interest. Automated
detection however has a few challenges: a)Inter-scanner and
intra-scanner variability in images (voxel intensities), b) noisy
images, c) ambiguous demarcation between sub-retinal layers
and finally d) variable shape, size, appearance and arbitrary
locations of cysts in the images. Early work on SD-OCT image
analysis focused on the intra-retinal tissue layer segmentation
[1] [2] [3] whereas attention to abnormality (such as cyst)
detection is very recent, with cyst segmentation being posed
as a challenge problem in MICCAI 2015.
An early approach proposed to detect cysts was semi-
automatic, based on GVF-snake to delineate the intra-retinal
and sub-retinal fluid regions in 2D OCT B-scans [6]. Later
methods were fully automatic and based on 2D analysis. A
denoising step was typically followed by a variety of ap-
proaches including thresholding and boundary tracing [7] and
texture-based classification of regions of interest derived with
a watershed algorithm [8]. 3D methods have been reported
more recently. A graph-search/graph-cut based approach that
simultaneously segments upper retinal surface, lower retinal
surface and fluid-filled regions in [9] reports good segmen-
tation only for large cysts. Since smaller fluid regions are
also of interest, voxel classification based approaches have
been attempted in [10] [11][12]. Among the recent approaches
are layer-dependent stratified sampling strategy to address the
class-imbalance (far fewer cyst vs healthy tissue voxels) [10],
geodesic graph cut method [11] and a kernel regression-based
classification [12]. Some of these can segment both the layers
and fluid-filled abnormalities while others focus only on the
abnormalities.
The MICCAI 2015 OPTIMA cyst segmentation challenge
was attempted by participants with a variety of approaches.
These range from machine learning with handcrafted fea-
tures such as intensity and layer thickness, CNN-based voxel
labeling [13] and graph-based method with layer-dependent
information [14]. The latter method has also been evaluated
on the public access DME dataset [15]. On the same dataset, a
fully convolutional deep learning architecture [16] is proposed

for segmentation of retinal layers and cysts. The preceding
methods are vendor independent. Vendor-specific methods
include 3D curvelet transform based dictionary learning [17]
and a marker controlled topographical watershed algorithm
[18]. Our simple approach [19] to extract candidates with
centre-surround filters and classify with an ensemble random
forest failed to perform well on the test set. The proceedings
of the challenge can be found at Optima website [20]. In this
paper, we propose an entirely different (from existing meth-
ods, including ours) approach based on biologically inspired
motion patterns and deep learning.
To summarise the current scenario, graph based segmenta-
tion such as [9] is inadequate to segment smaller fluid filled
regions which is addressed by existing voxel classification
based methods which rely on accurate layer segmentation
to derive features. However, segmentation of layers in the
presence of abnormalities, is still an open problem. The CNN
based method in [13] employs three separate networks at
different scales to handle the size variability of cysts, which is
a major drawback. The 3-network solution increases the time
for training and testing and is also memory consuming. The
parametric approaches such as [17] and [18] are highly vendor
dependent. An alternate approach could be to directly detect
the cystoid regions and then segment them. We take such an
approach and propose a novel, biologically inspired pipeline
for segmentation of cysts. The novel aspects of the proposed
method are as follows.
• Unique representation for the OCT data, based on motion
patterns proposed earlier by our group [21][22].
• Selective enhancement of the objects of interest (cysts)
with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
• Combining both 2D and 3D information in CNN for
detecting the cyst regions.
• Vendor independent and robust system for detecting and
localizing cysts.
It is noteworthy that the use of a CNN for enhancing the
objects of interest is a major departure from its popular use
in literature, namely voxel classification. We show that this
novel strategy leads to superior segmentation performance
even with a simple, clustering-based post processing step. The
next section provides details of the proposed system.

II. PROPOSED PIPELINE
The proposed pipeline consists of three main stages, namely,
preprocessing, detection and clustering. The preprocessing
stage is described in sub-section II-A; the detection of cyst
regions via a selective enhancement operation is explained in
sub-section II-B and segmentation via clustering is described
in sub-section II-C.
A. Preprocessing
1) Region of interest extraction: SD-OCT volumes are
generally acquired with different operator-defined protocols.
Consequently the layer orientation, resolution and number of
slices in the acquired volumes vary widely. In order to address
this variability, the size of each slice f(x, y) was standardized
to a 512×256 pixels by resizing. Since, the region of interest
is only 40% of each slice, for every given volume, a rough
region of interest (ROI) was derived as follows: each slice
image was projected along columns to obtain a 1D profile
and a Gaussian was fit to this profile. The mean value of the
Gaussian profile corresponds to a row index x0 in the slice.
An ROI of size 250×256, centered at x0 was finally extracted
and used for further processing.
2) De-noising: The SD-OCT volumes are degraded by
speckle noise. Speckle noise is signal dependent and hence
depends on the structure of the tissue in an OCT volume. A
total variational denoising method [23] was used to denoise
all ROIs. This reduces the texture content and results in a
smoother image. A sample ROI extracted from an original
slice and the corresponding denoised result are shown in Fig
1(a) and Fig 1(b).
3) Extraction of layers of interest: Cysts are known to
be restricted to the layers between Internal Limiting Mem-
brane (ILM) and Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). Various
segmentation algorithms have been proposed for segmenting
retinal layers. Some of these include pixel intensity variation-
based ILM and RPE segmentation [24], active contour with
a two-step kernel-based optimization scheme [2], complex
diffusion filtering with combined structure tensor replacing
thresholding [1]. In this work, an accurate, graph-based seg-
mentation approach [3] was used to extract only the ILM and
RPE layers to form a mask (see Fig. 1(c)). This mask serves
as a position prior in the detection stage as explained below.
B. Detection of cyst regions
Localization of the objects of interest is a vital task in a
segmentation problem. We propose to address this task via
a selective enhancement process wherein cysts are enhanced
without the knowledge of the layer positions. Selective en-
hancement is done by employing the notion of Generalized
Motion Pattern (GMP). The GMP was introduced in our earlier
work [21] and has been shown to be effective in diabetic
macular edema detection [22]. In this work, we construct an
ensemble of these GMPs and learn a function (using a CNN)
to combine them such that only cysts are enhanced. A detailed
description is provided next.
1) Generalized motion patterns: When one captures an
image of a racing car, depending on the camera setting, a
streak effect or motion blur is observed due to the fast moving
object. A related phenomenon is seen when a disc with multi
color segments is rotated at an appropriate rate: the colors

smear and leave an (visual) impression of a white disc. GMP
is the synthetic (discrete) equivalent of this phenomenon. It
is derived by inducing motion (such as translation, rotation)
to an image and can be used to represent an image. Let an
image be denoted by f . Applying motion (transformation T)
to f results in a stack S of images
S =
{
fj
}N
j=?N (1)
where,
fj = f(jT (?)); j ? [?N,N ] (2)
where ? denotes the transformation parameter. In our work, T
was chosen to be a translation which is applied in the direction
?, in steps of ? resulting in an image stack of size 2N + 1.
Applying a coalescing function ?(.) to the stack yields a GMP.
G?(f) = ?(S) = ?
{
(fj)
}N
j=?N (3)
The direction of the translation ? and the choice of coalescing
function is dependent on the problem being solved. In the
problem at hand, since the object of interest is a cyst which is
a dark structure, a minimum (min) operation is an appropriate
choice for ?.
In our earlier work, GMPs derived using translation and
rotation were shown to be useful in discriminating between
images of normal and abnormal cases [21][22]. The segmen-
tation of abnormalities was not addressed. We propose to solve
the cyst segmentation problem by deriving GMPs in multiple
directions ? and combining them such that cysts are selectively
enhanced.
A cake of GMPs (C) is constructed by stacking multi-
direction GMPs. C is defined as
C =
{
G?(f)
}K
?=1
=
{
?
{
(fj)
}N
j=?N
}K
?=1
(4)
We propose to map the stack to a single image Io in which
the cysts alone are enhanced. Let ? denote this mapping.
Io = ?(C) (5)
The above idea is illustrated with a phantom image designed
to model an OCT slice in Fig. 2. It has a dark blob in the
first layer and a bright blob in the last layer representing
a cyst and a drusen, respectively. A stack S of translated
images obtained from original image is shown in Fig.2. The
GMP was derived by applying a min coalescing function on
seven translated images fj . A cake of GMP C is obtained
by applying translation in eight different ? directions. It can
be observed that the dark blob gets smeared or extended
in the layer and the relatively dark layers are wider in the
direction ?; whereas the bright blob disappears. The final map
Io is shown in Fig.2 with ? chosen as a simple sum. Here,
both morphological changes as well as blur is evident. With
a simple
?
for ?, no contextual or shape information is
exploited. Hence, there is not much differentiation between
a blob and layer in terms of the net effect. This motivates
us to learn a function that enhances only objects of interest
by using relevant information while suppressing other tissues.
This type of enhancement is useful when the aim is to localize
cysts as it is now possible to interpret the pixel values in the
enhanced image as a likelihood (probability) measure for the
pixel belonging to a cyst. We propose to use a CNN to learn
the function ? such that cysts are enhanced while other normal
anatomical structures are suppressed.
2) Learning function ? using CNN: CNNs are biologically-
inspired variants of feed forward multi layer perceptron.
Since convolution filter weights are shared across all spatial
positions, the free parameters being learned reduces and thus
reducing the memory requirements to run the network. A CNN
architecture is formed by a stack of layers that transform the
input to an output. The three building blocks in our CNN are:
(i) convolutional layer with filters that learn specific type of
feature in the input at some spatial position (ii) maxpooling
which downsamples the image by retaining the maximum in a
local neighborhood (iii) sigmoid activation function that non-
linearly maps the intensity values of an image to an interval
[0,1].
The task is to detect cysts from a ROI volume of size
X × Y × Z where X = 250 and Y = 256. We utilize the
domain knowledge for our work i.e, cysts are 3D structures and
thus use consecutive slices as 3D information. The position
prior for the cysts is given by the mask extracted from the
4
Fig. 3. Proposed CNN architecture
ROI. In order to detect cysts from the Zth slice, 2 types of
inputs (to the CNN) are derived from them. Input1 provides
3D information and hence is a concatenation of the cakes C
(of 250 × 256 × K; K = 8) for the Zth slice and its 2
neighbors, i.e., (Z?1)th and (Z+1)th slices along with their
respective position prior. Thus the size of Input1 is 250 × 256
× 3 × 8+1) to CNN. Input2 provides just 2D information for
the Zth slice and hence is composed of its Cake C along with
its position prior. The size of Input2 is hence 250 × 256 ×
8+1. All images were normalized to have zero mean value
and unit variance. A detailed description of the architecture is
given in Table I. Sigmoid activation function is applied on the
learned feature map to obtain a probability map.
The CNN architecture shown in 3 is designed to utilize
neighborhood information. Stage 1 in the CNN architecture
collapses the 3D information into a 2D map without any
contextual information. In stage 2 at a lower scale, a large field
of view is assessed to combine 3D information to a 2D map.
The output of stage 1 is stacked with the second input(Input2)
for Stage 3 which enhances the boundary information at the
original scale. For the final stage, output from stage2 and stage
3 are concatenated as to form the input. A large neighborhood
in 2D is considered for this stage to strengthen the object of
interest and weaken the background information. The size of
the receptive field is chosen such that the largest cyst in the
dataset is enclosed in the field.
A weighted binary cross entropy loss function was chosen
to handle the class imbalance in the data, i.e, cyst versus
background pixel. This was minimized using gradient descent.
The evolution of the probability maps learned (depicted as heat
maps), as epochs increase is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen
that cysts gradually take shape in the map.
C. Segmentation
The trained CNN model learns a function ? that combines
the cake of GMP C to produce a probability map with cyst
pixels having higher probability score than background pixels.
Due to the smearing effect of GMP, a rough region around the
objects of interests (cysts), rather than accurate cyst regions,
are detected. Thus, segmentation is required to obtain a precise
cyst boundary. The probability map is thresholded to obtain
a binary map representing detected cyst regions. This map
is multiplied with the ROI image to extract the detected
regions in the intensity space. K-means clustering is applied
on this product image. Detected regions are clustered into
cysts, false positives region and background in the intensity
space. Since cysts are relatively darker regions compared to the
false positive regions, the clusters with lower mean intensity
are retained as desired cyst segments.
III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
The proposed pipeline was implemented on a NVIDIA GTX
960 GPU, with 4GB of GPU RAM on a core i3 processor. In
order to assess the performance of our method, the experi-
ments were carried out on 3 datasets: the MICCAI 2015’s
OPTIMA Cyst Segmentation Challenge (OCSC) dataset [25],
the publicly available DME dataset [15] and a locally sourced
(from Anand Eye Institute, Hyderabad) dataset referred to as
AEI.
The OCSC dataset has 15 training and 15 testing volumes
acquired from 4 different scanners; included are manual mark-
ings of cysts from two graders. An overview of the dataset is

shown in Table II. The resolution and density of the volumes
vary from 496 × 512 to 1024 × 512 and 5 to 200 B-scans,
respectively. The DME dataset has 10 Spectralis scans with 61
B-scans and 496 resolution each. The manual tracings (from
two experts) for these data are provided sparsely (11 B-scans
per volume) and not for continuous slices. The AEI dataset
has 10 volumes from Optovue scanner with varying number
of (30-51) B-scans and fixed resolution of 640 × 304. Cyst
boundaries for every fifth B-scan of each volume was collected
from an expert.
The proposed system was trained on the OCSC training
dataset by taking the intersection of the markings of grader
1(G1) and grader 2(G2) as ground truth (GT). Only slices
with cysts were used during training. A separate validation
set was formed by randomly selecting a cyst containing slice
from each volume in the OCSC train dataset. The CNN was
implemented in Theano using the Keras library. Training for
1500 epochs took about a day and a half. A stochastic gradient
descent optimizer as used to minimize the weighted binary
cross entropy loss. The training parameters were: learning rate
of 0.001; Nesterov momentum was set to 0.75 and batch size
was chosen as 8.
A. Experiments on system design
Next, we describe a set of experiments that were done to
study the impact on system performance. Specifically, these
were to study the effect of i) varying the GMP parameters,
ii) variants of the proposed system and iii) the choice of
threshold value which is used to binarise Io. Since OCSC
is the largest dataset, all experiments were done by training
on the OCSC training set and testing on the OCSC testing
set. System performance was assessed by computing the Dice
Coefficient (DC) defined below.

as it indicates a perfect match between computed result and
GT.
1) Effect of different GMP parameters: GMP computation
requires choosing a few parameters such as the step size ?,
range or extent of translation N and the number of translation
directions or number of GMPs K. The last two directly affect
the information content and size of cake C which is mapped
by the CNN (by learning a function). K and N were varied
while ? was held constant (= 1). The output of the CNN (Io)
was thresholded to obtain the detected cyst regions. Since these
are highly localized, they were treated as roughly segmented
cysts and evaluated using DC. Fig. 7 shows the computed DC
as a function of K with N = 5.
The DC is seen to increase initially and saturate after K =
8. For K < 8 the cake is smaller which implies has less
information to CNN and hence inadequate learning. Since the
training time increases with the cake size, K = 8 was chosen
for all our further experiments.
Next, the extent of translation N was varied. Specifically,
N = 2, 5, 10 were considered. Small (large) value for N
implies a small (large) range of induced motion. Since motion
serves to spatially extend the cyst (along ?), a large N is
potentially beneficial for detection of small cysts. However,
this can lead to merging of cysts with dark background or
give rise to false positives, given the fairly dense retinal layer
structure. A small N helps overcome these problems, however
at the risk of failure to detect small cysts. Thus the DC versus
N plot can be expected to have a mode. This is confirmed in
Fig. 8.
In experiments described henceforth, each of the GMP was
created by applying translation motion on a ROI slice with
N = 5, ? = 1 and ? = 0? to 180? (in steps of 22.5?); C was
derived by using a min coalescing function over a stack of
K = 8 GMPs.
2) Effect of variants of the system: The proposed CNN
architecture combines contextual information at 2D as well
as 3D levels. To assess their relative effectiveness, a simple
CNN architecture which relies only on 2D local information
was considered by plugging out stages 1 and 2 in the proposed
architecture. A cyst is a 3D structure and hence the 2D CNN
model can be expected to perform poorly compared to 2D+3D
CNN model (proposed). The DC listed in Table III, is seen to
improve with the addition of 3D information by 14%.
3) Effect on threshold at the CNN output: The thresholded
result of the probability map (CNN output) represents a rough
segmentation. The impact of this threshold on rough and
fine segmentation was also assessed. The plot in figure Fig.
9 shows the DC and Jaccard index (JI) as a function of
threshold level. Both increase initially as the rough segments
continue to improve. DC and JI fall with threshold values
above 0.5 since more noisy pixels are passed on. When the
threshold exceeds 0.7 the DC obtained after clustering drops
below the DC obtained prior to clustering. This is because,
thresholding at a high probability score leads to fewer false

affects clustering. However, at a threshold of 0.35, clustering
is seen to improve the performance by 7.8%. This was chosen
as the optimal value for system evaluation.

B. Evaluation of the system performance
Qualitative results of the proposed method are shown in
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The probability map computed by the
CNN, thresholded result overlaid on the original image and
the final segmentation results are shown for a sample slice
from 4 different scanners. It can be observed that the method
is able to produce probability maps which highlight the cysts
when present and nearly flat maps when cysts are absent.
The thresholded outputs (in column d of Fig. 5) and final
segments (in column e of Fig. 5) indicate that segmentation
is consistently good for large and small cysts and the false
detections are also minimal. The results also appear to be
robust to inter scanner variation in contrast/intensity.

Next, we present the segmentation performance of the
proposed system. Metrics such as DC, JI, Positive Predictive
Value (PPV) and Sensitivity were used by OCSC organizers
for evaluating the different segmentation methods. Since DC
and JI convey very similar message, we choose to evaluate our
work using DC alone. In order to assess the strengths of the
proposed solution, we evaluate the work quantitatively against
the U-Net [26] a widely used deep network for biomedical
image segmentation tasks. It was trained end to end on the
OCSC training set with standard augmentation. The obtained
mean DC for the OCSC test set and cross validation results
on DME and AEI dataset are listed in Table IV. The 6.1%
improvement seen with GMP as input relative to ROI as input,
substantiates the importance of using appropriate representa-
tion for the input data. U-net has pooling and upsampling
stages in the architecture which are memory intensive. The
training for U-net had to be done on a GPU (NVIDIA TITAN
X) with higher memory capacity.
Finally, we benchmark the proposed system against i)
the participants of the challenge on OCSC test set and ii)
methods reported on DME dataset. The mean DC values are
presented in Table V. The results on the OCSC test set for the
participants of the challenge are taken from the OCSC website
[27]. The overall DC values obtained for different datasets are
listed (in rank order) separately in Table V. Here, G1 and
G2 denote the GT from 2 graders; Unmasked (U) denotes
the entire volume while Masked (M) denotes a volume with
masked central 3 mm circular region centered at macula as
described in [25]; (S) in the row of Esmaeili et al. denotes the
results are for only Spectralis scanner. It should be noted that
results reported in [17] are for the OCSC training set whereas
the DC values listed in the table are for the OCSC test set.
The DC values should be nearly equal for M and U volumes
if detection is not sensitive to location and this holds only for
the proposed method which outperforms all other methods on
the OCSC test dataset.
In the DME dataset, the uncertainty of fluid boundaries is
reflected by the difference in DC values (0.65/0.9) for the
two manual raters. Both [12] [14] have reported results on
this dataset though the latter report only the volume similarity
error metric and not DC. We consider DC as the standard
metric for evaluating the performance of a segmentation task
and hence benchmark with [12]. The DC values against the
two experts as well as their union on DME dataset are given
in Table V. On the AEI dataset, the obtained DC value was
0.79/0.18. The superior performance of the proposed system
on the DME dataset and AEI dataset is noteworthy given that
our system was not separately trained on these datasets.
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
An automated retinal cyst segmentation algorithm was
presented. It is a generic approach which is independent of
scanners and does not require layer segmentation which is in
contrast to existing approaches. For instance, layer-dependent
statistical information is used to define a cost function in the
graph based method in [14] and serves as a feature in machine
learning based algorithm in [12]. Our method depends only on

extracting an ROI between ILM and RPE for processing. The
heart of the proposed method is a novel representation derived
by inducing motion. The CNN is used to selectively enhance
the object of interest and aid in detection of the object. As
only few parameters are to be learnt, CNN training is possible
with only 584 sample slices (containing cysts) from the OCSC
training dataset. The architecture of the CNN is designed
to utilize contextual information in both 2D and 3D and at
multiple scales which results in good performance on large
cysts and small fluid regions. The effectiveness of the CNN is
underscored by the fact that its thresholded output is able to
achieve results similar to the other methods proposed during
the MICCAI challenge. A simple clustering on this output
improved the DC by nearly 7.8%. The cross validation results
on the DME dataset and AEI dataset points to the robustness
of the proposed method. On explicit training on DME dataset,
DC of 0.77 was achieved by [16].
The proposed system has some limitations. It fails to detect
cyst regions which are very small in a volume especially when
they are isolated in depth. These are sometimes treated as noise
and rejected. Sample failure cases are shown in Fig. 10. It also
tends to merge small cysts, when they are adjacent to a large
one and this in turn affects the DC value. One such case is
seen in the second row of Fig. 5.
Besides cysts which are fluid filled regions, quantifying fatty

deposits such as drusen in the RPE layer, which occur in Age-
related macular degeneration, are also of interest in OCT im-
age analysis. The proposed segmentation method can easily be
extended to handle drusen by simply replacing the coalescing
function with max. This we believe is because our strategy
for localization is selective enhancement of the abnormality of
interest, agnostic to the location of the abnormality. Further
improvement in the work is possible by embedding domain-
assisted spatial information in the input to the CNN.
