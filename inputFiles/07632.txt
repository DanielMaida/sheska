Abstract
Convolutional neural networks with spatio-temporal 3D
kernels (3D CNNs) have an ability to directly extract spatio-
temporal features from videos for action recognition. Al-
though the 3D kernels tend to overfit because of a large
number of their parameters, the 3D CNNs are greatly im-
proved by using recent huge video databases. However, the
architecture of 3D CNNs is relatively shallow against to the
success of very deep neural networks in 2D-based CNNs,
such as residual networks (ResNets). In this paper, we pro-
pose a 3D CNNs based on ResNets toward a better action
representation. We describe the training procedure of our
3D ResNets in details. We experimentally evaluate the 3D
ResNets on the ActivityNet and Kinetics datasets. The 3D
ResNets trained on the Kinetics did not suffer from overfit-
ting despite the large number of parameters of the model,
and achieved better performance than relatively shallow
networks, such as C3D. Our code and pretrained models
(e.g. Kinetics and ActivityNet) are publicly available at
https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets.
1. Introduction
One important type of real-world information is human
actions. Automatically recognizing and detecting human
action in videos are widely used in applications such as
surveillance systems, video indexing, and human computer
interaction.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve high per-
formance in action recognition [2, 6, 15, 18]. Most of the
CNNs use 2D convolutional kernels [5, 6, 15, 20, 22], sim-
ilar to the CNNs for image recognition. The two-stream
architecture [15] that consists of RGB and optical flow
streams is often used to represent spatio-temporal informa-
tion in videos. Combining the both streams improves action
recognition performance.
Another approach that captures the spatio-temporal in-
formation adopts spatio-temporal 3D convolutional kernels
[2, 10, 18] instead of the 2D ones. Because of the large
number of parameters of the 3D CNNs, training them on
relatively small video datasets, such as UCF101 [16] and
HMDB51 [13], leads to lower performance compared with
the 2D CNNs pretrained on large-scale image datasets, such
as ImageNet [3]. Recent large-scale video datasets, such as
Kinetics [12], greatly contribute to improve the recognition
performance of the 3D CNNs [2, 12]. The 3D CNNs are
competitive to the 2D CNNs even though their architectures
are relatively shallow compared with the architectures of 2D
CNNs .
Very deep 3D CNNs for action recognition have not been
explored enough because of the training difficulty caused
by the large number of their parameters. Prior work in
image recognition shows very deep architectures of CNNs
improves recognition accuracy [7, 17]. Exploring various
deeper models for the 3D CNNs and achieving lower loss
at convergence are important to improve action recognition
performance. Residual networks (ResNets) [7] are one of
the most powerful architecture. Applying the architecture
of ResNets to 3D CNNs is expected to contribute further
improvements of action recognition performance.
In this paper, we experimentally evaluate 3D ResNets to
get good models for action recognition. In other words, the
goal is to generate a standard pretrained model in spatio-
temporal recognition. We simply extend from the 2D-based
ResNets to the 3D ones. We train the networks using the
ActivityNet and Kinetics datasets and evaluate their recog-
nition performance.
Our main contribution is exploring the effectiveness of
ResNets with 3D convolutional kernels. We expect that this
work gives further advances to action recognition using 3D
CNNs.

2. Related Work
We here introduce action recognition databases and ap-
proaches.
2.1. Action Recognition Database
The HMDB51 [13] and UCF101 [16] are the most suc-
cessful databases in action recognition. The recent consen-
sus, however, tells that these two databases are not large-
scale databases. It is difficult to train good models with-
out overfitting using these databases. More recently, huge
databases such as Sports-1M [11] and YouTube-8M [1]
are proposed. These databases are big enough whereas
their annotations are noisy and only video-level labels (i.e.
the frames that do not relate to target activities are in-
cluded). Such noise and unrelated frames might prevent
models from good training. In order to create a successful
pretrained model like 2D CNNs trained on ImageNet [3],
the Google DeepMind released the Kinetics human action
video dataset [12]. The Kinetics dataset includes 300,000
or over trimmed videos and 400 categories. The size of Ki-
netics is smaller than Sports-1M and YouTube-8M whereas
the quality of annotation is extremely high.
We use the Kinetics in order to optimize 3D ResNets.
2.2. Action Recognition Approach
One of the popular approach of CNN-based action recog-
nition is two-stream CNNs with 2D convolutional kernels.
Simonyan et al. proposed the method that uses RGB and
stacked optical flow frames as appearance and motion in-
formation, respectively [15]. They showed combining the
two-streams improves action recognition accuracy. Many
methods based on the two-stream CNNs are proposed to
improve action recognition performance [5, 6, 20, 22]. Fe-
ichtenhofer et al. proposed combining two-stream CNNs
with ResNets [6]. They showed the architecture of ResNets
is effective for action recognition with 2D CNNs. Differ-
ent from the above mentioned approaches, we focused on
3D CNNs, which recently outperform the 2D CNNs using
large-scale video datasets.
Another approach adopts CNNs with 3D convolutional
kernels. Ji et al. proposed to apply the 3D convolution
to extract spatio-tepmoral features from videos. Tran et al.
trained 3D CNNs, called C3D, using the Sports-1M dataset
[11]. They experimentally found 3 × 3 × 3 convolutional
kernel achieved best performance. Varol et al. showed ex-
panding temporal length of inputs for 3D CNNs improves
recognition performance [19]. They also found using op-
tical flows as inputs to 3D CNNs outperforms RGB inputs
and combining RGB and optical flows achieved best perfor-
mance. Kay et al. showed the results of 3D CNNs on their
Kinetics dataset are competitive to the results of 2D CNNs
pretrained on ImageNet whereas the results of 3D CNNs on

the UCF101 and HMDB51 are inferior to the results of the
2D CNNs. Carreira et al. introduced the inception archi-
tecture [17], which is very deep network (22 layers), to the
3D CNNs and achieved state-of-the-art performance [2]. In
this paper, we introduce the ResNet architecture, which out-
performs the inception architecture in image recognition, to
the 3D CNNs.
3. 3D Residual Networks
3.1. Network Architecture
Our network is based on ResNets [7]. ResNets introduce
shortcut connections that bypass a signal from one layer to
the next. The connections pass through the gradient flows
of networks from later layers to early layers, and ease the
training of very deep networks. Figure 1 shows the residual
block, which is an element of ResNets. The connections
bypass a signal from the top of the block to the tail. ResNets
are conssits of multiple residual blocks.
Table 1 shows our network architecture. The difference
between our networks and original ResNets [7] is the num-
ber of dimensions of convolutional kernels and pooling.
Our 3D ResNets perform 3D convolution and 3D pooling.
The sizes of convolutional kernels are 3 × 3 × 3, and the
temporal stride of conv1 is 1, similar to C3D [18]. The net-
work uses 16 frame RGB clips as inputs. The sizes of input
clips is 3 × 16 × 112 × 112. Down-sampling of the inputs
is performed by conv3 1, conv4 1, conv5 1 with a stride
of 2 When the number of feature maps increased, we adopt
identity shortcuts with zero-padding (type A in [7]) to avoid
increasing the number of parameters.
Table 1: Network Architecture. Residual blocks are shown in brackets. Each con-
volutional layer is followed by batch normalization [9] and ReLU [14]. Down-
sampling is performed by conv3 1, conv4 1, conv5 1 with a stride of 2. The
dimension of last fully-connected layer is set for the Kinetics dataset (400 cate-
gories).

3.2. Implementation
3.2.1 Training
We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum
to train our network. We randomly generate training sam-
ples from videos in training data to perform data augmen-
tation. We first select temporal positions of each sample by
uniform sampling. 16 frame clips are generated around the
selected temporal positions. If the videos are shorter than
16 frames, we loop the videos as many times as necessary.
We then randomly selects the spatial positions from the 4
corner or 1 center, similar to [21]. In addition to the po-
sitions, we also select the spatial scales of each sample to
perform multi-scale cropping [21]. The scales are selected
from
{
1, 1
21/4
, 1?
2
, 1
21/4
, 12
}
. The scale 1 means a maxi-
mum scale (i.e. the size is the length of short side of frame).
The aspect ratio of cropped frame is 1. The generated sam-
ples are horizontally flipped with 50% probability. We also
perform mean subtraction for each sample. All generated
samples have the same class labels as their original videos.
To train the 3D ResNets on the Kinetics dataset, we use
SGD with a mini-batch size of 256 on 4 GPUs (NVIDIA
TITAN X) using the training samples described above. The
weight decay is 0.001 and the momentum is 0.9. We start
from learning rate 0.1, and divide it by 10 for three times af-
ter the validation loss saturates. In preliminary experiments
on the ActivityNet dataset, large learning rate and batch size
was important to achieve good recognition performance.
3.2.2 Recognition
We recognize actions in videos using the trained model. We
adopt the sliding window manner to generate input clips,
(i.e. each video is split into non-overlapped 16 frame clips.)
Each clip is cropped around a center position with the max-
imum scale. We estimate class probabilities of each clip
using the trained model, and average them over all clips of
a video to recognize actions in videos.
4. Experiments
4.1. Dataset
In the experiments, we used the ActivityNet (v1.3) [4]
and Kinetics datasets [12]. The ActivityNet dataset pro-
vides samples from 200 human action classes with an av-
erage of 137 untrimmed videos per class and 1.41 activity
instances per video. The total video length is 849 hours, and
the total number of activity instances is 28,108. The dataset
is randomly split into three different subsets: training, vali-
dation and testing, where 50% is used for training, and 25%
for validation and testing.

Figure 2: Training of the models on the ActivityNet dataset. The size of ActivityNet is relatively small (20,000 videos)
compared with the Kinetics (300,000 videos) and Sports-1M (1,000,000). The 3D ResNet overfitted because of the relatively
small size whereas the C3D got better accuracies without overfitting.
The Kinetics dataset has 400 human action classes, and
consists of 400 or more videos for each class. The videos
were temporally trimmed, so that they do not include non-
action frames, and last around 10 seconds. The total num-
ber of the videos is 300,000 or over. The number of train-
ing, validation, and testing sets are about 240,000, 20,000,
40,000, respectively.
The number of activity instances of the Kinetics is ten
times larger than that of the ActivityNet whereas the total
video lengths of the both datasets are close.
For both datasets, we resized the videos to 360 pixels
height without changing their aspect ratios, and stored them.
4.2. Results
We first describe the preliminary experiment on the Ac-
tivityNet dataset. The purpose of this experiment is explor-
ing the training of the 3D ResNets on the relatively small
dataset. In this experiment, we trained 18-layer 3D ResNet
described in Table 1 and Sports-1M pretrained C3D [18].
Figure 2 shows the training and validation accuracies in the
training. The accuracies were calculated based on recogni-
tion of not entire videos but 16 frame clips. As shown in
Figure 2 (a), the 3D ResNet-18 overfitted so that its vali-
dation accuracies was significantly lower than the training
ones. This result indicates that the ActivityNet dataset is
too small to train the 3D ResNets from scratch. By contrast,
Figure 2 (b) shows that the Sports-1M pretrained C3D did
not overfit and achieved better recognition accuracy. The
relatively shallow architecture of the C3D and pretraining
on the Sports-1M dataset prevent the C3D from overfitting.
We then show the experiment on the Kinetics dataset.
Here, we trained 34-layer 3D ResNet instead of 18-layer
one because the number of activity instances of the Kinetics
is significantly larger than that of the ActivityNet. Figure 3
shows the training and validation accuracies in the training.
The accuracies were calculated based on recognition of 16
frame clips, similar to Figure 2. As shown in Figure 3 (a),
the 3D ResNet-34 did not overfit and achieved good perfor-
mance. The Sports-1M pretrained C3D also achieved good
validation accuracy, as shown in Figure 3 (b). Its training
accuracy, however, was clearly lower than the validation
accuracy, (i.e. the C3D underfitted). In addition, the 3D
ResNet is competitive to the C3D without pretraining on
the Sports-1M dataset. These results indicate that the C3D
is too shallow and the 3D ResNets are effective when using
the Kinetics dataset.
Table 2 shows accuracies of our 3D ResNet-34 and
state-of-the-arts. C3D w/ BN [12] is the C3D that em-
ploy batch normalization after each convolutional and fully
connected layers. RGB-I3D w/o ImageNet [2] is the in-
ception [17], which is very deep network (22 layers) sim-
ilar to the ResNets, -based CNNs with 3D convolutional
kernels. Here, we show the results of the RGB-I3D with-
out pretraining on the ImageNet. The ResNet-34 achieved
higher accuracies than Sports-1M pretrained C3D and C3D
with batch normalization trained from scratch. This result
supports the effectiveness of the 3D ResNets. By contrast,
RGB-I3D achieved the best performance whereas the num-
ber of depth of ResNet-34 is greater than that of RGB-I3D.
A reason for this result might be the difference of number

of used GPUs. Large batch size is important to train good
models with batch normalization [2]. Carreira et al. used 32
GPUs to train the RGB-I3D whereas we used 4 GPUs with
256 batch size. They might use more large batch size on
their training and it contribute to the best performance. An-
other reason might be the difference of sizes of input clips.
The size for the 3D ResNet is 3 × 16 × 112 × 112 due to
the GPU memory limits whereas that for the RGB-I3D is
3× 64× 224× 224. High spatial resolutions and long tem-
poral durations improve recognition accuracy [19]. There-
fore, using a lot of GPUs and increasing batch size, spatial
resolutions, and temporal durations might achieve further
improvements of 3D ResNets.

ResNets-34.
5. Conclusion
We explore the effectiveness of ResNets with 3D con-
volutional kernels. We trained the 3D ResNets using the
Kinetics dataset, which is a large-scale video datasets. The
model trained on the Kinetics performs good performance
without overfitting despite the large number of parameters
of the model. Our code and pretrained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets.

of each row are cropped at center positions and show part of the original videos. The three
top rows are correctly recognized results. The bottom row is a wrongly recognized result.
Because of the very high computational time of the train-
ing of 3D ResNets (three weeks), we mainly focused on the
ResNets-34. In future work, we will conduct additional ex-
periments for deeper model (ResNets-50, -101) and other
deep architectures, such as DenseNets-201 [8].
