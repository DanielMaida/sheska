Abstract—There is surprisingly little known about agenda
setting for international development in the United Nations
(UN) despite it having a significant influence on the process
and outcomes of development efforts. This paper addresses this
shortcoming using a novel approach that applies natural language
processing techniques to countries’ annual statements in the
UN General Debate. Every year UN member states deliver
statements during the General Debate on their governments’
perspective on major issues in world politics. These speeches
provide invaluable information on state preferences on a wide
range of issues, including international development, but have
largely been overlooked in the study of global politics. This paper
identifies the main international development topics that states
raise in these speeches between 1970 and 2016, and examine the
country-specific drivers of international development rhetoric.
I. INTRODUCTION
Decisions made in international organisations are fundamen-
tal to international development efforts and initiatives. It is in
these global governance arenas that the rules of the global
economic system, which have a huge impact on development
outcomes are agreed on; decisions are made about large-
scale funding for development issues, such as health and
infrastructure; and key development goals and targets are
agreed on, as can be seen with the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). More generally, international organisations
have a profound influence on the ideas that shape international
development efforts [1].
Yet surprisingly little is known about the agenda-setting
process for international development in global governance
institutions. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the lack
of information on how the different goals and targets of
the MDGs were decided, which led to much criticism and
concern about the global governance of development [2]. More
generally, we know little about the types of development issues
that different countries prioritise, or whether country-specific
factors such as wealth or democracy make countries more
likely to push for specific development issues to be put on
the global political agenda.
The lack of knowledge about the agenda setting process
in the global governance of development is in large part due
to the absence of obvious data sources on states’ preferences
about international development issues. To address this gap
we employ a novel approach based on the application of
natural language processing (NLP) to countries’ speeches in
the UN. Every September, the heads of state and other high-
level country representatives gather in New York at the start
of a new session of the United Nations General Assembly
(UNGA) and address the Assembly in the General Debate.
The General Debate (GD) provides the governments of the
almost two hundred UN member states with an opportunity
to present their views on key issues in international politics –
including international development. As such, the statements
made during GD are an invaluable and, largely untapped,
source of information on governments’ policy preferences on
international development over time.
An important feature of these annual country statements is
that they are not institutionally connected to decision-making
in the UN. This means that governments face few external
constraints when delivering these speeches, enabling them to
raise the issues that they consider the most important. There-
fore, the General Debate acts “as a barometer of international
opinion on important issues, even those not on the agenda
for that particular session” [3]. In fact, the GD is usually the
first item for each new session of the UNGA, and as such
it provides a forum for governments to identify like-minded
members, and to put on the record the issues they feel the
UNGA should address. Therefore, the GD can be viewed as
a key forum for governments to put different policy issues on
international agenda.
We use a new dataset of GD statements from 1970 to
2016, the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), to examine
the international development agenda in the UN [4].1 Our
application of NLP to these statements focuses in particular
on structural topic models (STMs) [5]. The paper makes two
contributions using this approach: (1) It sheds light on the main
international development issues that governments prioritise in
the UN; and (2) It identifies the key country-specific factors
associated with governments discussing development issues in

their GD statements.
THE UN GENERAL DEBATE AND INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT
In the analysis we consider the nature of international
development issues raised in the UN General Debates, and
the effect of structural covariates on the level of developmental
rhetoric in the GD statements. To do this, we first implement
a structural topic model [5]. This enables us to identify the
key international development topics discussed in the GD.
We model topic prevalence in the context of the structural
covariates. In addition, we control for region fixed effects
and time trend. The aim is to allow the observed metadata
to affect the frequency with which a topic is discussed in
General Debate speeches. This allows us to test the degree of
association between covariates (and region/time effects) and
the average proportion of a document discussing a topic.
A. Estimation of topic models
We assess the optimal number of topics that need to be spec-
ified for the STM analysis. We follow the recommendations of
the original STM paper and focus on exclusivity and semantic
coherence measures. [6] propose semantic coherence measure,
which is closely related to point-wise mutual information
measure posited by [7] to evaluate topic quality. [6] show
that semantic coherence corresponds to expert judgments and
more general human judgments in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
experiments.
Exclusivity scores for each topic follows [8]. Highly fre-
quent words in a given topic that do not appear very often
in other topics are viewed as making that topic exclusive.
Cohesive and exclusive topics are more semantically useful.
Following [9] we generate a set of candidate models ranging
between 3 and 50 topics. We then plot the exclusivity and
semantic coherence (numbers closer to 0 indicate higher co-
herence), with a linear regression overlaid (Figure 1). Models
above the regression line have a “better” exclusivity-semantic
coherence trade off. We select the 16-topic model, which has
the largest positive residual in the regression fit, and provides

higher exclusivity at the same level of semantic coherence.
The topic quality is usually evaluated by highest probability
words, which is presented in Figure 2.
B. Topics in the UN General Debate
Figure 2 provides a list of the main topics (and the highest
probability words associated these topics) that emerge from
the STM of UN General Debate statements. In addition to the
highest probability words, we use several other measures of
key words (not presented here) to interpret the dimensions.
This includes the FREX metric (which combines exclusivity
and word frequency), the lift (which gives weight to words that
appear less frequently in other topics), and the score (which
divides the log frequency of the word in the topic by the log
frequency of the word in other topics). We provide a brief
description of each of the 16 topics here.
Topic 1 - Security and cooperation in Europe.
The first topic is related to issues of security and coopera-
tion, with a focus on Central and Eastern Europe.
Topic 2 - Economic development and the global system.
This topic is related to economic development, particularly
around the global economic system. The focus on ‘trade’,
‘growth’, ‘econom-’, ‘product’, ‘growth’, ‘financ-’, and etc.
suggests that Topic 2 represent a more traditional view of
international development in that the emphasis is specifically
on economic processes and relations.
Topic 3 - Nuclear disarmament.
This topic picks up the issue of nuclear weapons, which has
been a major issue in the UN since its founding.
Topic 4 - Post-conflict development.
This topic relates to post-conflict development. The coun-
tries that feature in the key words (e.g. Rwanda, Liberia,
Bosnia) have experienced devastating civil wars, and the
emphasis on words such as ‘develop’, ‘peace’, ‘hope’, and
‘democrac-’ suggest that this topic relates to how these coun-
tries recover and move forward.
Topic 5 - African independence / decolonisation.
This topic picks up the issue of African decolonisation
and independence. It includes the issue of apartheid in South
Africa, as well as racism and imperialism more broadly.
Topic 6 - Africa.
While the previous topic focused explicitly on issues of
African independence and decolonisation, this topic more
generally picks up issues linked to Africa, including peace,
governance, security, and development.
Topic 7 - Sustainable development.
This topic centres on sustainable development, picking up
various issues linked to development and climate change. In
contrast to Topic 2, this topic includes some of the newer
issues that have emerged in the international development
agenda, such as sustainability, gender, education, work and
the MDGs.
Topic 8 - Functional topic.
This topic appears to be comprised of functional or process-
oriented words e.g. ‘problem’, ‘solution’, ‘effort’, ‘general’,
etc.
Topic 9 - War.
This topic directly relates to issues of war. The key words
appear to be linked to discussions around ongoing wars.
Topic 10 - Conflict in the Middle East.
This topic clearly picks up issues related to the Middle East
– particularly around peace and conflict in the Middle East.
Topic 11 - Latin America.
This is another topic with a regional focus, picking up on
issues related to Latin America.
Topic 12 - Commonwealth.
This is another of the less obvious topics to emerge from
the STM in that the key words cover a wide range of issues.
However, the places listed (e.g. Australia, Sri Lanka, Papua
New Guinea) suggest the topic is related to the Commonwealth
(or former British colonies).
Topic 13 - International security.
This topic broadly captures international security issues (e.g.
terrorism, conflict, peace) and in particularly the international
response to security threats, such as the deployment of peace-
keepers.
Topic 14 - International law.
This topic picks up issues related to international law,
particularly connected to territorial disputes.
Topic 15 - Decolonisation.
This topic relates more broadly to decolonisation. As well
as specific mention of decolonisation, the key words include a
range of issues and places linked to the decolonisation process.
Topic 16 - Cold War.
This is another of the less tightly defined topics. The topics
appears to pick up issues that are broadly related to the
Cold War. There is specific mention of the Soviet Union, and
detente, as well as issues such as nuclear weapons, and the
Helsinki Accords.
Based on these topics, we examine Topic 2 and Topic 7
as the principal “international development” topics. While a
number of other topics – for example post-conflict develop-
ment, Africa, Latin America, etc. – are related to development

issues, Topic 2 and Topic 7 most directly capture aspects of
international development. We consider these two topics more
closely by contrasting the main words linked to these two
topics. In Figure 3, the word clouds show the 50 words most
likely to mentioned in relation to each of the topics.
The word clouds provide further support for Topic 2 repre-
senting a more traditional view of international development
focusing on economic processes. In addition to a strong
emphasis on ’econom-’, other key words, such as ‘trade’,
‘debt’, ‘market’, ‘growth’, ‘industri-’, ‘financi-’, ‘technolog-
’, ‘product’, and ‘argicultur-’, demonstrate the narrower eco-
nomic focus on international development captured by Topic

development, with key words including ‘climat-’, ‘sustain’,
‘environ-’, ‘educ-’, ‘health’, ‘women’, ‘work’, ‘mdgs’, ‘peac-
’, ‘govern-’, and ‘right’. Therefore, Topic 7 captures many of
the issues that feature in the recent Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) agenda [10].
Figure 4 calculates the difference in probability of a word
for the two topics, normalized by the maximum difference in
probability of any word between the two topics. The figure
demonstrates that while there is a much high probability
of words, such as ‘econom-’, ‘trade’, and even ‘develop-
’ being used to discuss Topic 2; words such as ‘climat-
’, ‘govern-’, ‘sustain’, ‘goal’, and ‘support’ being used in
association with Topic 7. This provides further support for the
Topic 2 representing a more economistic view of international
development, while Topic 7 relating to a broader sustainable
development agenda.
We also assess the relationship between topics in the STM
framework, which allows correlations between topics to be
examined. This is shown in the network of topics in Figure 5.
The figure shows that Topic 2 and Topic 7 are closely related,
which we would expect as they both deal with international
development (and share key words on development, such as
‘develop-’, ‘povert-’, etc.). It is also worth noting that while
Topic 2 is more closely correlated with the Latin America
topic (Topic 11), Topic 7 is more directly correlated with the
Africa topic (Topic 6).
II. EXPLAINING THE RHETORIC
We next look at the relationship between topic proportions
and structural factors. The data for these structural covariates
is taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators
(WDI) unless otherwise stated. Confidence intervals produced
by the method of composition in STM allow us to pick up
statistical uncertainty in the linear regression model.
Figure 6 demonstrates the effect of wealth (GDP per capita)
on the the extent to which states discuss the two international
development topics in their GD statements. The figure shows
that the relationship between wealth and the topic proportions

linked to international development differs across Topic 2
and Topic 7. Discussion of Topic 2 (economic development)
remains far more constant across different levels of wealth than
Topic 7. The poorest states tend to discuss both topics more
than other developing nations. However, this effect is larger for
Topic 7. There is a decline in the proportion of both topics as
countries become wealthier until around $30,000 when there
is an increase in discussion of Topic 7. There is a further
pronounced increase in the extent countries discuss Topic 7
at around $60,000 per capita. However, there is a decline in
expected topic proportions for both Topic 2 and Topic 7 for
the very wealthiest countries.
Figure 7 shows the expected topic proportions for Topic 2
and Topic 7 associated with different population sizes. The fig-
ure shows a slight surge in the discussion of both development
topics for countries with the very smallest populations. This
reflects the significant amount of discussion of development
issues, particularly sustainable development (Topic 7) by the
small island developing states (SIDs). The discussion of Topic
2 remains relatively constant across different population sizes,
with a slight increase in the expected topic proportion for
the countries with the very largest populations. However, with

Topic 7 there is an increase in expected topic proportion until
countries have a population of around 300 million, after which
there is a decline in discussion of Topic 7. For countries
with populations larger than 500 million there is no effect of
population on discussion of Topic 7. It is only with the very
largest populations that we see a positive effect on discussion
of Topic 7.
We would also expect the extent to which states discuss in-
ternational development in their GD statements to be impacted
by the amount of aid or official development assistance (ODA)
they receive. Figure 8 plots the expected topic proportion
according to the amount of ODA countries receive. Broadly-
speaking the discussion of development topics remains largely
constant across different levels of ODA received. There is,
however, a slight increase in the expected topic proportions of
Topic 7 according to the amount of ODA received. It is also
worth noting the spikes in discussion of Topic 2 and Topic 7
for countries that receive negative levels of ODA. These are
countries that are effectively repaying more in loans to lenders
than they are receiving in ODA. These countries appear to raise
development issues far more in their GD statements, which is
perhaps not altogether surprising.

Fig. 9. Effect of democracy. Main effect and 95% confidence interval.
We also consider the effects of democracy on the expected
topic proportions of both development topics using the Polity
IV measure of democracy [11]. Figure 9 shows the extent
to which states discuss the international development topics
according to their level of democracy. Discussion of Topic 2 is
fairly constant across different levels of democracy (although
there are some slight fluctuations). However, the extent to
which states discuss Topic 7 (sustainable development) varies
considerably across different levels of democracy. Somewhat
surprisingly the most autocratic states tend to discuss Topic
7 more than the slightly less autocratic states. This may
be because highly autocratic governments choose to discuss
development and environmental issues to avoid a focus on
democracy and human rights. There is then an increase in the
expected topic proportion for Topic 7 as levels of democracy
increase reaching a peak at around 5 on the Polity scale,
after this there is a gradual decline in discussion of Topic
7. This would suggest that democratizing or semi-democratic
countries (which are more likely to be developing countries
with democratic institutions) discuss sustainable development
more than established democracies (that are more likely to be
developed countries).
We also plot the results of the analysis as the difference
in topic proportions for two different values of the effect of
conflict. Our measure of whether a country is experiencing
a civil conflict comes from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict
Dataset [12]. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals
are plotted in Figure 10. The figure shows that conflict affects
only Topic 7 and not Topic 2. Countries experiencing conflict
are less likely to discuss Topic 7 (sustainable development)
than countries not experiencing conflict. The most likely
explanation is that these countries are more likely to devote
a greater proportion of their annual statements to discussing
issues around conflict and security than development. The fact
that there is no effect of conflict on Topic 2 is interesting in
this regard.
Finally, we consider regional effects in Figure 11. We use
the World Bank’s classifications of regions: Latin America and
the Caribbean (LCN), South Asia (SAS), Sub-Saharan Africa

(SSA), Europe and Central Asia (ECS), Middle East and
North Africa (MEA), East Asia and the Pacific (EAS), North
America (NAC). The figure shows that states in South Asia,
and Latin America and the Caribbean are likely to discuss
Topic 2 the most. States in South Asia and East Asia and
the Pacific discuss Topic 7 the most. The figure shows that
countries in North America are likely to speak about Topic 7
least.
The analysis of discussion of international development
in annual UN General Debate statements therefore uncovers
two principle development topics: economic development and
sustainable development. We find that discussion of Topic
2 is not significantly impacted by country-specific factors,
such as wealth, population, democracy, levels of ODA, and
conflict (although there are regional effects). However, we
find that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable
development (Topic 7) in their annual GD statements varies
considerably according to these different structural factors.
The results suggest that broadly-speaking we do not observe
linear trends in the relationship between these country-specific
factors and discussion of Topic 7. Instead, we find that there
are significant fluctuations in the relationship between factors
such as wealth, democracy, etc., and the extent to which these
states discuss sustainable development in their GD statements.
These relationships require further analysis and exploration.
III. CONCLUSION
Despite decisions taken in international organisations having
a huge impact on development initiatives and outcomes, we
know relatively little about the agenda-setting process around
the global governance of development. Using a novel approach
that applies NLP methods to a new dataset of speeches in
the UN General Debate, this paper has uncovered the main
development topics discussed by governments in the UN, and
the structural factors that influence the degree to which gov-
ernments discuss international development. In doing so, the
paper has shed some light on state preferences regarding the
international development agenda in the UN. The paper more
broadly demonstrates how text analytic approaches can help
us to better understand different aspects of global governance.
