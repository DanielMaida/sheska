Abstract—In this article, we present a survey of recent ad-
vances in passive human behaviour recognition in indoor areas
using the channel state information (CSI) of commercial WiFi
systems. Movement of human body causes a change in the
wireless signal reflections, which results in variations in the CSI.
By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities
and comparing them against stored models, human behaviour
can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI
data streams and using machine learning techniques to build
models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that
are presented herein have great performances, however, instead
of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we
propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term
memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and show the
improved performance. We also discuss about different challenges
such as environment change, frame rate selection, and multi-user
scenario, and suggest possible directions for future work.

I. BACKGROUND ON TRADITIONAL ACTIVITY
RECOGNITION SYSTEMS
HUMAN activity recognition has gained tremendous at-tention in recent years due to numerous applications that
aim to monitor the movement and behaviour of humans in
indoor areas. Applications such as health monitoring and fall
detection for elderly people [1], contextual awareness, activity
recognition for energy efficiency in smart homes [2] and many
other Internet of Things (IoT) based applications [3].
In existing systems, the individual has to wear a device
equipped with motion sensors such as gyroscope and ac-
celerometer. The sensor data is processed locally on the wear-
able device or transmitted to a server for feature extraction and
then supervised learning algorithms are used for classification.
This type of monitoring is known as active monitoring. The
performance of such system is shown to be around 90% for
recognition of activities such as sleeping, sitting, standing,
walking, and running [4].

Wang of Nanjing University, China for the helpful discussions on CARM and

However, always wearing a device is cumbersome and
may not be possible for many passive activity recognition
applications, where the person may not be carrying any sensor
or wireless device. While camera-based systems can be used
for passive activity recognition, the line-of-sight (LOS) re-
quirement is a major limitation for such systems. Furthermore,
the camera-based approaches have privacy issues and cannot
be employed in many environments. Therefore, a passive
monitoring system based on wireless signal, which does not
violate the privacy of people, is desired.
Because of ubiquitous availability in indoor areas, recently,
WiFi has been the focus of much research for activity recog-
nition. Such systems consist of a WiFi access point (AP) and
one or several WiFi enabled devices located at different parts
of the environment. When a person engages in an activity,
body movement affects the wireless signals and changes the
multi-path profile of the system.
A. Techniques Based on Wi-Fi Signal Power
The received signal strength (RSS) has been used success-
fully for active localization of wireless devices using WiFi
fingerprinting techniques as summarized in [5]. The RSS has
also been used as a metric for passive tracking of mobile
objects [6]. When the person is located between the WiFi
device and access point (AP), the signal will be attenuated
and hence a different RSS is observed. Although RSS is very
simple to use and can be easily measured, it cannot capture the
real changes in the signal due to the movement of the person.
This is because the RSS is not a stable metric even when there
is no dynamic change in the environment [7].
B. Techniques Requiring Modified WiFi Hardware
To use some other metrics than RSS, in some systems,
the WiFi system is modified so that extra information can
be extracted from the signal. The WiFi USRP software radio
system is a modified WiFi hardware and has been used for 3D
passive tracking in WiTrack [7]. The idea is to measure the
Doppler shift in the orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) signals, caused due to movement of human body
using a technique called frequency modulated carrier wave
(FMCW). Since the Doppler shift is related to the distance,
the location of the target can be estimated. Using similar idea
to WiTrack, in WiSee [2], the USRP system is used to measure
the Doppler shift in OFDM signals due to movement of human
body. The movement of the parts of the body toward the
receiver causes positive Doppler shift, while moving the body

parts away results in negative shift. For instance for a gesture
moving at 0.5m/s, in a 5GHz system, the Doppler shift will be
around 17Hz [2]. Therefore, such small Doppler shifts need
to be detected in the system. In WiSee, the received signal
is transformed into narrow-band pulses of few Hertz, and
the WiSee receiver tracks the Doppler shift in the frequency
of these pulses. After transforming the wide-band 802.11 to
narrow-band pulses, the next steps in WiSee are as follows.
1) Doppler Extraction: To extract the Doppler information,
WiSee computes the frequency-time Doppler profile by taking
the FFT over samples in a window of half a second and
then shifting the window by 5ms and continuing this process.
This technique is also known as short-time Fourier Transform
(STFT), which was used in other techniques as well [8], [9].
Since the movement of human body generally has a speed of
0.25m/s to 4m/s, the Doppler shifts at 5 GHz is between 8Hz
and 134Hz, hence only the FFT output in this frequency range
is considered in WiSee.
2) Segmentation: The next step is to segment the STFT data
to distinguish different patterns. For example, a gesture might
consist of one segment with positive and negative Doppler
shifts, or two or more segments, each of which has a positive
and negative Doppler shift. Detecting a segment is based on
the energy detection over a small duration. If the energy is 3dB
higher than the noise level, then the beginning of the segment
is found and if it is less than 3dB, then the segment has ended.
3) Classification: The idea of classification is quite simple.
Each segment has three possibilities: only positive Doppler
shifts, only negative Doppler shift, and segments with both
positive and negative shifts, based on which three numbers
are assigned to them. Thus each gesture is represented by a
sequence of numbers. The classification task is to compare the
obtained sequence with the one used during training.
WiSee also claims that the system can detect multiple
moving targets and identify their activities using the idea that
the reflections from each mobile target can be regarded as a
signal from a wireless transmitter. Therefore, using the idea
used in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) receivers, the
reflected signals due to different people moving in the area
can be separated. The problem is to find the weight matrix
that when multiplied with the Doppler energy corresponding to
each segment of each antenna, maximizes the Doppler of each
segment. To this end, iterative algorithms have been employed.
In contrast to techniques such as WiSee that requires spe-
cialized USRP software radios, there has been several efforts
to employ commercial WiFi APs without the need to modify
the WiFi system. To represent the dynamic changes in the
environment due to movement of human body, recently other
metrics have been employed, such as channel state information
(CSI), which will be described in more details below.
II. WIFI CHANNEL STATE INFORMATION
A. CSI of WiFi System
The wireless devices with IEEE 802.11n/ac standards are
using multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. By using
MIMO technology, it is possible to increase the diversity
gain, array gain, and multiplexing gain, while reducing the
co-channel interference [10]. The modulation used in IEEE
802.11 is OFDM where the bandwidth is shared among
multiple orthogonal subcarriers. Due to the small bandwidth,
the fading that each subcarrier faces is modeled as flat fading.
Therefore, using OFDM, the small scale fading property of
the channel can be mitigated.
Let MT denote the number of transmit antennas at the
device, and MR the number of receive antennas at the AP.
The MIMO system at any time instant can be modeled as
yi = Hixi + ni , for i ? {1, . . . , S} where S is the number of
OFDM subcarriers, and xi ? RMT and yi ? RMR represent
the transmit and received signal vectors for the i-th subcarrier,
respectively, and ni is the noise vector. The channel matrix for
i-th subcarrier Hi , which consists of complex values, can be
estimated by dividing the output signal with a known sequence
of input also known as pilot. The channel matrix is also known
as the CSI, as it shows how the input symbol is affected
by the channel to reach at the receiver. In OFDM systems,
each subcarrier faces a narrow-band fading channel, and by
obtaining the CSI for each subcarrier, there will be diversity
in the observed channel dynamics. This is the main advantage
of using CSI compared to RSS, in which the changes are
averaged out over all the WiFi bandwidth and hence cannot
capture the change at certain frequencies. In some commercial
network interface cards (NICs), such as Intel NIC 5300 the
CSI can be collected using the tool provided in [11].
B. Limitations and Errors of WiFi Systems
The amplitude of CSI is generally a reliable metric to use
for feature extraction and classification, although it can change
with transmission power, and transmission rate adaptation. As
will be discussed later, by using filtering techniques, the burst
noise can be reduced [9]. However, in contrast to amplitude,
the phase of WiFi system is affected by several sources of
error such as carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling
frequency offset (SFO). The CFO exists due to the difference
in central frequencies (lack of synchronization) between the
transmitter and receiver clocks. The CFO for a period of 50µs
of 5GHz WiFi band can be as large as 80KHz, leading to
phase change of 8?. Therefore, the phase changes due to the
movement of the body, which is generally smaller than 0.5?, is
not observable from phase change. The other source of error,
SFO, is generated by the receiver analog to digital converter
(ADC). The SFO is also varying by subcarrier index, therefore,
each subcarrier faces a different error.
Due to the unknown CFO and SFO, using the raw phase
information may not be useful. However, a linear transfor-
mation is proposed in [12], such that the CFO and SFO can
be removed from the calibrated phase. This process is also
known as phase sanitization. In Fig. 1, the CSI amplitude, CSI
phase and sanitized CSI phase versus the subcarrier index are
plotted for a scenario where the WiFi transmitter and receiver
are located in the vicinity of each other in LOS condition.
As observed, the CSI amplitude is relatively stable but forms
some clusters as mentioned in [12]. The raw phase increases
with subcarrier index since the SFO grows with subcarrier
index, as illustrated in Fig. 1-(b). After phase sanitization, the
IEEE COMMUNICATION MAGAZINE, DRAFT 3
change of phase due to SFO will be reduced as observed in
Fig. 1-(c).
C. Effect of Human Motion on Wireless Channel
The movement of the humans and objects change the
multipath characteristic of the wireless channel and hence the
estimated channel will have a different amplitude and phase.
The CSI amplitude for one subcarrier and all the antennas,
related to a person walking and sitting down between a WiFi
transmitter and receiver, is illustrated in Fig. 2-(a). The person
is stationary for the first 400 packets but then starts walking or
sitting down. As observed, when the person is not moving, the
CSI amplitudes for all antennas are relatively stable, however,
when the activity starts, the CSIs start changing drastically.
The walking period is longer than sitting in this experiment
because when the person sits down he remains stationary.
The received phase, is very distorted due to the CFO and
SFO, as mentioned earlier. This can be observed in Fig. 2-(b).
However, using the phase sanitization technique, the effect of
errors in phase can be eliminated. The calibrated phase can be
observed in Fig. 2-(c).
III. WI-FI CSI-BASED BEHAVIUOR RECOGNITION
In this section, we provide a summary of the techniques
using commercial WiFi NICs. The general diagram of activity
recognition systems using WiFi CSI is illustrated in Fig. 3.
A. Histogram-based Techniques
One of these technique is E-Eyes [13], in which the CSI
histograms are used as fingerprints in a database. In test phase,
by comparing the histogram of the obtained CSI with the
database, the closest one is found and hence the activity can be
recognized. The preprocessing steps is to do low-pass filtering
and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index filtering.
The former is necessary to remove the high frequency noise,
which may not be due to the human movement, and the latter
is needed to reduce the unstable wireless channel variations.
Although the performance of this technique is good and its
computational cost is low, the histogram technique is sensitive
to environment changes and hence may not perform well for
varying environments.
B. CARM
Recently, other techniques have been proposed such as
WiHear [3], CARM [9], and [14]. In WiHear, directional
antennas are used to capture CSI variations caused by the
movement of mouth. The performance of WiHear is good,
however, the application is only to monitor the spoken words.
In [14], the authors use advanced feature extraction and
machine learning techniques for recognition of typed word
on a keyboard. The idea is similar to the idea in CARM [9],
which will be described in more detail below.
1) CSI De-noising: The CSI is noisy and may not show
distinctive features for different activities. Therefore, it is
necessary to first filter-out the noise and then extract some
features to be used for classification using machine learning
techniques. There are different methods for filtering the noise
such as Butterworth low-pass filters [9]. However, due to the
existence of burst and impulse noises in CSI, which have high
bandwidths, the low-pass filter cannot yield a smooth CSI
stream [9].
It has been shown that there are better techniques for
this purpose such as principal component analysis (PCA)
de-noising [9]. The PCA is a technique for dimensionality
reduction of a large dimension system using the idea that
most of the information about the signal is concentrated over
some of the features. In CARM, the first principal component
is discarded to reduce the noise, and the next five ones
are employed for feature extraction. By removing the first
principal component, the information due to the dynamic
reflection coming from mobile target is not lost because it
is also captured in other principal components. After PCA de-
noising of CSI data, some features are extracted from it so it
can be used for classification. The feature extraction will be
discussed below.
2) Feature Extraction: One way to extract features from a
signal is to transform it to another domain, such as frequency
domain. The fast Fourier transform (FFT), which is an efficient
implementation of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can be
used for this purpose. To this end, a window size of certain
number of CSI samples is selected and then the FFT is applied
on each segment by sliding the window. This technique is
known as short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which can
detect the frequency changes of a signal over time. The STFT
was used in radar for detection of the movement of torso and
legs in [8]. In Fig. 4, the STFT (spectrogram) of CSI for
different activities is shown for CSI data collected at 1KHz
rate. As observed in Fig. 4, the activities that involve drastic
movements such as walking and running show high energy in
high frequencies in the spectrogram.
In [3], [9], [14], DWT is employed to extract features
from CSI as a function of time. The DWT provides high
time resolution for activities with high frequencies and high
frequency resolution for activities with low speeds. Each
level of DWT represents a frequency range, where the lower
levels contain higher frequency information while higher levels
contain lower frequencies. The advantage of DWT to STFT
as mentioned in [9] are:
• DWT can provide a nice trade-off in time and frequency
domain,
• DWT reduces the size of the data as well, so it becomes
suitable for machine learning algorithms.
In CARM, a 12 level DWT is employed to decompose the
five principal components (after removing the first principal
component). Then the five values of the DWT are averaged.
For every 200ms, CARM extracts a 27 dimensional feature
vector including three sets of features:
• the energy in each wavelet level, representing the intensity
of movements with different speeds,

intervals,

technique [8].
These features are used as the input to the classification
algorithm described below.
3) Machine Learning for Classification: Different machine
learning techniques can be used for multi-class classification
based on certain features that are extracted. Some of the pop-
ular classification techniques are logistic regression, support
vector machines (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), and
deep learning. Since the activity data is in a sequence, CARM
uses HMM and it is shown that satisfactory results can be
obtained.
C. Using Deep Learning for Behaviour Recognition
The problem of activity recognition is somewhat similar to
the speech recognition process, where traditionally HMM has
been used for classification. However, deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) has been considered as a counterpart of HMM.
Training RNN is difficult as it suffers from vanishing or
exploding gradient problem, however, it has been shown in
[15] that using the long short term memory (LSTM) extension
of RNN, the best accuracy for speech recognition so far can
be achieved. Therefore, we propose using LSTM for activity
recognition rather than other conventional machine learning
techniques, such as HMM, although feature extraction is not
done similar to CARM. Using LSTM has two advantages.
First, the LSTM can extract the features automatically, in other
words, there is no necessity to pre-process the data. Second,
LSTM can hold temporal state information of the activity,
i.e., LSTM has the potential to distinguish similar activities
like "Lay down" and "Fall". Since "Lay down" consist of
"Sit down" and "Fall", the memory of LSTM can help in
recognition of these activities.
IV. EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT METHODS
In this section, we implement different methods as well as
our proposed method and show the performance of each one.
A. Measurement Setup
We do the experiments in an indoor office area where the Tx
and Rx are located 3 meters apart in LOS condition. The Rx
is equipped with a commercial Intel 5300 NIC, with sampling
rate of 1KHz. A person starts moving and doing an activity
within a period of 20 seconds in LOS condition, while in the
beginning and at the end of the time period the person remains
stationary. We also record videos of activities so we can label

the data. Our data set includes 6 persons, 6 activities, denoted
as "Lay down, Fall, Walk, Run, Sit down, Stand up", and 20
trials for each one.
B. Evaluating Machine Learning Techniques
We apply the PCA on the CSI amplitude, and then use
STFT to extract features in the frequency domain for every
100 ms. We only use the first 25 frequency components out
of 128 frequency bins as most of the energy of activities is
in lower frequencies, and in this way, the feature vector does
not become sparse.
First, we use random forest with 100 trees for classification
of activities. To have a feature vector that contains enough
information about an activity, the modified STFT bins are
stacked together in a vector for every 2 seconds of activity,
hence every feature vector will be of length 1000. We also
implemented other techniques such as support vector machine,
logistic regression, and decision tree, however, random forest
outperformed these techniques. The confusion matrix for ran-
dom forest is shown in Table I-(a) and as observed, decent
performance can be obtained for some of the activities, but
not for activities such as "Lay down", "Sit down" and "Stand
up".
We also apply HMM on the extracted features using STFT
and use the MATLAB toolbox for HMM training. Note that
HMM is also used in CARM, however, DWT and the tech-
nique in [8] are used for feature extraction. The result is shown
in Table I-(b) and improved accuracy compared to random
forest can be observed, although with higher computation time
needed for training. Although the performance of HMM is
good, especially for "Walk" and "Run", it sometimes miss-
classifies "Stand up" with "Sit down" or "Lay down".
We evaluate the performance of LSTM using Tensorflow
in Python. The input feature vector is the raw CSI amplitude
data, which is a 90 dimensional vector (3 antennas and 30 sub-
carriers). The LSTM approach is different from conventional
approaches in the sense that it does not use PCA and STFT
and can extract features from CSI directly. The number of
hidden units is chosen to be 200 where we consider only one
hidden layer. For numerical minimization of cross entropy,
we use the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with batch
size 200 and learning rate of 10?4. Our result is shown in
Table I-(c), where the accuracy is over 75% for all activities.
One of the drawbacks of using LSTM in this way is the long
training time compared to HMM, however, using deep learning
packages such as Tensorflow one can also use GPUs and speed
up the training. Once the LSTM is trained the test can be done
quickly.
V. DISCUSSIONS
A. Effect of Environment Change on the Performance
The CSI characteristics are not the same for different envi-
ronments and different people. There are different techniques
to reduce the influence of environments [9]. For instance,
after using PCA, the first component includes mainly the CSI
information due to stationary objects [9]. By discarding the
first principal component, the information due to mobile target

is mainly captured. Therefore, using this technique relatively
similar features can be obtained for different environments.
Other techniques such as STFT and DWT represent the speed
of change in the multi-paths which is related to the speed of
movement of human body parts. Although the same activities
in different environments result in very different CSI charac-
teristics, due to similarity in the change of signal reflections,
similar features can be obtained for different environments and
people using STFT or DWT [9].
B. Effect of Wi-Fi transmission rate on the performance
In order for the CSI to show noticeable changes due to the
movement, the rate of transmission should be high enough
(nearly 1KHz) to capture activities that are done quickly. We
have observed severely degraded performance of classification
methods when sampling rate is around 50 Hz. Increasing
the frame rate increases the number of samples and hence
the computational cost increases for de-noising and feature
extraction. Increasing the frame rate may also not help further
after some point because human movement speed is limited in
indoor areas. Therefore, by selecting a suitable sampling rate
(around 1KHz), a good trade-off between the computational
cost and the accuracy can be obtained.
C. Using CSI Phase Information
Due to the errors such as CFO and SFO, the phase of
WiFi CSI has been rarely used for activity recognition in the
IEEE COMMUNICATION MAGAZINE, DRAFT 7
literature. However, by subtracting the phase information of
neighboring antennas from one another, the CFO and SFO are
omitted. The phase difference is related to the angle of arrival
(AOA) although there is integer ambiguity in the number of
full cycles of the received signal. The change in the target
location can change the AOA and hence the phase difference.
When the movement is fast and drastic, the signal will be
scattered by the human body more randomly, and hence the
AOA and phase difference will change faster. It might be
thus helpful to use phase difference together with amplitude
for feature extraction and then apply classification algorithms,
however, further investigation will be left for future work due
to lack of space.
D. Multi-user Activity Recognition
While the performances of many activity recognition algo-
rithms have been tested for a single user, the more interesting
and also challenging problem is the case where multiple people
are in the environment. One solution has been proposed in [2]
to use the idea of MIMO receivers to separate the signals
due to two distinct mobile objects. Having multiple receivers
might also help in distinguishing the activities of multiple
users. Some techniques for multi-speaker recognition might
be applicable to the activity recognition problem, however,
this remains an interesting open problem.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, a survey of recent advancements in human
activity recognition systems using WiFi channel has been
provided. The literature in this area shows great promise
in achieving good accuracy in indoor environments. Using
numerical test it has been observed that better accuracy can
be obtained by employing deep learning techniques such as
RNN LSTM rather than methods such as HMM. There are
still several challenges that need to be addressed in future
work such as how to use CSI phase information in addition
to the amplitude, how to make the system robust in different
dynamic environments, and how to identify the behaviours of
multiple users.
