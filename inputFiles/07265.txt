Text network analysis has received increasing attention as a consequence of its wide range of
applications. In this work, we extend a previous work founded on the study of topological features
of mesoscopic networks. Here, the geometrical properties of visualized networks are quantified
in terms of several image analysis techniques and used as subsidies for authorship attribution.
It was found that the visual features account for performance similar to that achieved by using
topological measurements. In addition, the combination of these two types of features improved the
performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the ever increasing availability of machine read-
able text, the interest in automatic textual analysis tools
has grown substantially given its potential for several
important applications. One area of special interest is
authorship attribution, which has been studied from dif-
ferent perspectives. In authorship attribution, we are
interested in assigning an author to a given text [1, 2].
Traditional approaches use statistical analysis of lexical
and syntactical features [1, 3, 4], while other methods
focus on text modeling using complex networks [5–10].
The latter is capable of representing structural as well
as semantic characteristics [11–14], complementing tra-
ditional methods.
Recently, a network method for text modeling was pro-
posed [15]. This method uses mesoscopic networks to
capture the flow of narratives. In [16], this approach
was used for authorship attribution. By mesoscopic it is
meant that the derived networks are able to reflect text
relationships at a topological scale larger than usually
approached by using, for instance, word adjacency. It
has been suggested that such model can provide insights
about the discursive structure of texts [16], an issue which
is explored further in the current work.
The work presented in [16] focuses on network feature
extraction, while the present incorporates features from
the visualizations of these networks. This has been done
to explore how the visual features of the networks, which
was called calligraphy in [16], can contribute to the ac-
curacy of authorship attribution. The framework used in
this work is illustrated in Figure 1. The obtained results
suggest that these network visual features are as capa-
ble as topological measurements to characterize authors’
styles. Furthermore, when the visual and topological fea-
tures were combined, a better result is achieved.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II defines the authorship attribution problem and
presents some traditional and network based approaches.
The proposed pipeline, which includes the process of ob-
taining mesoscopic networks and the selected image and
network measurements, is presented in Section III. Then,

II. RELATED WORK
Given a text of unknown or disputed authorship and
a set of candidate authors, the goal of an authorship at-
tribution is to identify the correct unknown author [1].
One of the most important findings in authorship studies
was reported by Mosteller and Wallace [17]. They inves-
tigated the authorship of several political documents and
discovered that the frequencies of common words – such
as some pronouns, prepositions, and articles – are useful
to characterize the authorship of texts.
Traditionally, works in authorship attribution use sim-
ple, yet useful features to characterize writing styles, such
as statistics extracted from words and characters (e.g.
frequency of the n-grams of words or characters, and the
frequency of punctuation marks) [1, 3, 4]. Syntactic and
semantic features can also be used for the task, such as
the frequency of the constituent parts of a sentence and
information about words synonyms [1]. In recent years,
authorship attribution has been studied from a different
perspective. Some works have taken advantage of dense
and real-valued vectorial representations and deep neu-
ral networks [18–20], such as their application to train
language models for each author or to learn continuous
vectors for n-grams of words.
Complex network-based approaches have also been
used to assign authorship. In most of these approaches,
co-occurrence networks are created from the texts [5–10].
Basically, in such approaches, co-occurrence networks are
created by connecting adjacent words. Then, several
topological measurements – such as the clustering coef-
ficient, degree, frequency of motifs – are extracted and
their respective values are used as features in machine
learning algorithms. These previous works have shown
that structure plays a prominent role in characterizing
authors’ styles. Interestingly, even if only stopwords are
used, the structure of the remaining structure in the net-
works is still essential for the accurate identification of
styles [8].
Another possibility for text representation is to map
texts as mesoscopic networks, thus providing a model
for identifying the relationship between larger chunks of
texts [15]. Interestingly, Marinho et al. [16] presented
mesoscopic networks created from a dataset and the pro-
vided visualizations revealed characteristics of the au-
thors, such as the preference for short stories over novels,
as well as characteristics of each text, such as the simi-
larities between the beginning and ending of a particular
book. These mesoscopic networks also characterize the
unfolding of the stories.
III. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our authorship attribution method is based on the
mesoscopic modeling approach [15]. The first step to
create mesoscopic networks is the preprocessing of the
text. In this study, we remove stopwords (such as arti-

cles and prepositions), and the remaining words are lem-
matized. The preprocessed text is then partitioned into
a set of paragraphs T = {p1, p2 . . . , pn}, where n is the
total number of paragraphs, and pi is the set of words
belonging to the same paragraph (see Figure 2(a)). Tak-
ing into account the paragraphs’ order, all possible sets
of ? consecutive paragraphs are grouped, as shown in
Figure 2(b). Each set W?i = {pi, pi+1 . . . , pi+??1} rep-
resents a network node. From these nodes, a weighted
and undirected network is created, in which all nodes i
and j are connected and the weights are computed as the
cosine similarity between the vector containing the values
of tf-idf statistics associated to each node [21], as illus-
trated in Figure 2(c). In the current study, we employed
the following tf-idf mapping:
tf-idf(w, d,D) =
fw,d
n
× log
(
|D|

)
, (1)
where fw,d is the frequency of a given word w occurring
in document d comprising n words, |D| is the total num-
ber of documents and dw is the number of documents in
which the word w occurs. Note that, in this approach,
each set of consecutive paragraphs W , i.e. each node, is
considered a document.
In order to obtain unweighted networks, we remove
the edges with the lowest weights until a certain criteria

is met, as can be seen in Figure 2(d). In this paper,
the selected criterion requires that all networks have the
same network average degree ?k? = 2E/N , where E is
the number of edges and N is the number of nodes. The
selected value for ?k? was 40. Note that such an approach
was previously used in [16].
Dataset
We used a dataset of 50 English texts written by 10
authors. These books are available from the Project
Gutenberg repository[39]. The list with the 50 texts is
presented in Table I.
Network analysis
After the networks have been created, topological mea-
surements can be extracted. Here, we measure accessi-
bility (for h = {2, 3}) [22], degree [23], backbone and
merged symmetry (for h = {2, 3, 4}) [24], assortativ-
ity [25], average degree of neighbors [26] and clustering
coefficient [23]. Because most of the selected measure-
ments apply to a single node, some statistics – such as
the average, standard deviation, and skewness – were ex-
tracted from each distribution and used as features for
the classification algorithms.
Image analysis
According to Marinho et al. [16], the visualization of
mesoscopic networks can provide information about the
writing style of authors. In the present study, we used
image processing analysis to extract characteristics from
these visualizations, which are used to characterize au-
thors. First, the complex networks are visualized, using
a force directed algorithm, which is based on attraction
force between connected nodes and repulsion force be-
tween all pairs of nodes [27]. To that end, we employed
the software provided by Silva et al. [28] with fixed pa-
rameters. 2D visualizations were used to remove the need
to define the projection angle. Furthermore, the images
were converted to monochromatic versions (called binary
images). A preprocessing step was employed in which
the images are dilated and eroded [29] in order to remove
small holes. We considered the object size and the higher
eigenvalue (?1) of the the Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) [30] to find the dilation kernel as follows:
cdim = c?1, (2)
where c is a constant, set as c = 3 · 10?4. In other words,
the larger the object is, the larger the kernel size.
The following features were extracted from the prepro-
cessed images:
1. Area : The object area A is calculated as the sum of
all pixels of the object in the image (see Figure 3);
2. Perimeter : The perimeter of an object, P , is the
arc length of the external border of the object. An
example is shown in Figure 3;
3. Euler number : This measurement is derived from
the number of holes in the image. It is computed
as:
e = No ?Nh, (3)
where Nh is the number of holes in the image and
No is the number of objects. An example is shown
in Figure 3, where No = 1, Nh = 2 and e = ?1.
Note that for all images in this study, No = 1;
4. Minimum enclosing circle : The minimum en-
closing circle Mc is the smallest circle that includes
all of the objects’ pixels [31]. We measured the
radius and the x and y coordinates of the central
point of this circle. Figure 3 illustrates these mea-
surements;
5. Convex hull : similar to the minimum enclosing
circle, the convex hull consists of the smallest con-
vex polygon including all the pixels from the ob-
ject [32] (see Figure 3). We compute the polygons’

that the Euler number of this image is e = ?1 because No = 1
and Nh = 2.
6. Elongation : This measurement quantifies how
stretched an object is. It is calculated as the ratio
between the variances of the first (?1) and second
(?2) axes of the PCA of the image [33].

?1 = 100 and ?2 = 50, so the elongation is 2.
7. Lacunarity : This feature [34] quantifies the vari-
ation of the size of the ‘voids’ of the objects in an
image, as shown in Figure 5. Note that when the
holes are more uniform, the lacunarity (L) value is
lower. In this study, we employed the self-referred
approach to lacunarity proposed by Rodrigues et
al. [35], which involves circular windows of radius
r.

nal (image) in the frequency domain [33]. In this

Non-overlapping rings with fixed width are defined
in the magnitude Fourier space. The entropy, av-
erage, and standard deviation value of magnitudes
inside each ring are obtained and employed as fea-

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section we will provide a qualitative analysis of
the visual properties of the mesoscopic networks studied
in this work, complemented by the discussion of accu-
racy of the authorship attribution results obtained from
experiments considering all authors and experiments con-
5
sidering only pairs of authors. Finally, we provide a prin-
cipal component analysis in order to visualize the data
clusterization.
Image analysis
So as to illustrate some of the visual specificities
present in the constructed networks in this paper, we
used a visualization method to generate three networks
from each of four different authors. These were: Edgar
Allan Poe, Saki, Mark Twain and Henry James. These
networks are presented in Figure 7. In order to better
visualize the narrative flow, color was added to the im-
ages. Several of the loops that appear in the images are
a consequence of the network visualization. These loops
could have been removed manually, but we chose not to
interfere in any step of the process.
The obtained images suggest a kind of visual network
whose edges are narrow strings while the nodes corre-
spond to intersections appearing along these strings. Ob-
serve that the string extremities also define nodes. Pieces
of the same string initiating and terminating in a node
are henceforth called visual loops. Nodes with several
connections are called visual hubs. Two types of these
hubs can be identified in Figure 7: tight hubs, as seen
in Huckleberry Finn’s network; and loose hubs, found in
The Turn of the Screw.
The images’ most noticeable feature is clearly the ab-
sence or presence of visual nodes in the networks. Both
Saki and Poe have networks without many nodes. This
can easily be explained since them both favor collections
of unrelated short stories. Nonetheless, there are some
small differences between the aforementioned networks;
Poe’s networks depict some small scale loops that are ab-
sent in Saki’s networks. We hypothesize that, although
these differences are visually minor, they will have a no-
table effect on the respective mesoscopic network mea-
surements.
Henry James’ The Real Thing and Other Tales also
present small scale loops, but in this case they are more
pronounced. Contrariwise, in the other books from
James, specially in The Turn of The Screw, the presence
of longer loops is more prevalent. We attribute this effect
to the book’s plot, where almost all the story consists of
the narration of a single character and her interactions
with only three other people inside a house, using there-
fore similar vocabulary throughout the book. We also
suspect that by being a suspense/horror story the narra-
tive keeps returning to the same place in order to build
up suspense.
Twain’s books also have their own peculiarities. His
books’ networks are much more convoluted than the
other authors’, having many more long loops. This is
indicative that he had a preference for re-using specific
patterns throughout his novels. These patterns could
possibly be attributed to either characters’ speech pat-
terns or situational vocabulary. The former are easily

seen in Huckleberry Finn’s network, organized around
a tight visual hub. In this novel, Twain tried to repre-
sent the phonetic differences of a slave’s speech pattern.
Therefore, whenever Jim (a recently freed slave) inter-
acts with other characters, several distinctive words are
used, causing it to have a very typical tf-idf distribution,
leading to the tight hub.
It is interesting to notice that both Huckleberry Finn
and The Turn of the Screw have many long loops and
also present a central hub, but there are clear differences.
We suppose that these differences are due to distinct un-
derlying reasons. In Huckleberry Finn, the long loops
appear to be caused by a single character distinctive vo-
cabulary. On the other hand, The Turn of the Screw is a
book that takes place mostly in the same location, with
few different characters, and therefore shares similar sit-
uations throughout the book, making these long loops
more spread out.
Authorship Attribution
In order to evaluate the capability of the proposed
method to classify books according to their respective
authors, we calculated all the image features, IF hence-
forth, described in Section III. These features were se-
lected and ordered according to SVM’s (Support Vector
Machine) attribute selection [36]. Furthermore, we used
expectation maximization (EM) [37] and KMeans [38],
which are unsupervised classifier algorithms. The num-
ber of classes was set to 10 in order to reflect the number
of authors. In order to find the best number of features,
we tested the n first features in the ranking by varying
n from 1 to F , where F is the total number of features
(see Table II). The best classification accuracy, 54%, was
achieved using n = 14. This result supports the hypoth-
esis that there are visual differences among the visualiza-
tions of the mesoscopic networks, which are captured by
the image features.
An alternative method to classify these texts is to use
features obtained from the complex network measure-
ments, or network features (NF). The selected measure-
ments were presented in Section III. We employed the
same machine learning methodology that was applied to
the image features and obtained an accuracy of 54% for
n = 15. We also combined all features (IF + NF) and
classified the texts using the same methodology. In this
case, a better accuracy rate was achieved: 58%, with
n = 19.

FIG. 7: The discussed mesoscopic networks.
Pairwise Authorship Attribution
In Figure 8 we have the results for pairwise classifi-
cations, where only two authors are considered for each
experiment. We utilize the classifiers with best accuracy
from the previous sub section. We can see that, as ex-
pected, the results that consider both image and network
features are better than those that consider only one type
of feature.
Note that the results reflect our analysis in subsection
IV: while the result for the comparison between Poe and
Saki, and James and Twain yielded an accuracy of 70%,
all other results have an 100% accuracy. This is a clear
indication that the features selected reflect our intuitions
and that it is even possible to discriminate between sim-
ilar networks, albeit improvements are desirable.
PCA
Finally, PCA was used to check if our image and net-
work features properly represent the desired characteris-
tics. Fourteen features were selected according to SVM
feature selector. We applied PCA to the image and net-
work features separately and achieved reasonable separa-
tion, specially with network features, as shown in Figure
9. Network and image features were combined achieving
a better separation, as depicted in Figure 10. According
to this figure, it is clear that our features are capable of
capturing some stylistic choices of the authors. For ex-
ample, Poe and Saki’s generated networks have similar
structures and are fairly close to one another, but the
features are distinctive enough to produce very little ac-
tual overlap. It is also interesting to note that the PCA
weights in Figure 11 show that both image and network
features have strong contribution to the separation.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this work we presented a distinct manner to extract
meaningful features from mesoscopic networks. Our ap-
proach involves the application of a comprehensive set
of image analysis techniques ranging from simpler ap-
proaches such as area and perimeter, to more sophisti-
cated methodologies such as Fourier spectra and lacu-
narity. More specifically, our results indicate that quan-
titative visual analysis of these networks yielded results
as good as those obtained using only topological features.
Moreover, the combination of both types of features im-
proves the attribution results.
Possible extensions of the proposed work include the
consideration of other types of texts and literary periods,
as well as to other types of data, such as those derived
from time series.
