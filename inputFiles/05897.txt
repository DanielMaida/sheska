Abstract 
We aimed to evaluate computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for lung nodule 
classification focusing on (i) usefulness of gradient tree boosting (XGBoost) and (ii) 
effectiveness of parameter optimization using Bayesian optimization (Tree Parzen 
Estimator, TPE) and random search. 99 lung nodules (62 lung cancers and 37 benign 
lung nodules) were included from public databases of CT images. A variant of local 
binary pattern was used for calculating feature vectors. Support vector machine (SVM) 
or XGBoost was trained using the feature vectors and their labels. TPE or random 
search was used for parameter optimization of SVM and XGBoost. Leave-one-out 
cross-validation was used for optimizing and evaluating the performance of our CADx 
system. Performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver 
operating characteristic analysis. AUC was calculated 10 times, and its average was 
obtained. The best averaged AUC of SVM and XGBoost were 0.850 and 0.896, 
respectively; both were obtained using TPE. XGBoost was generally superior to SVM. 
Optimal parameters for achieving high AUC were obtained with fewer numbers of trials 
when using TPE, compared with random search. In conclusion, XGBoost was better 
than SVM for classifying lung nodules. TPE was more efficient than random search for 
parameter optimization.

Introduction 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States1 because it is 
frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage and this prevents effective treatment. Results 
from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) show that compared with chest X-ray 
screening, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT significantly reduced lung cancer 
mortality among heavy smokers by detecting lung cancers at an early stage2,3. However, 
false positives in low-dose CT screening can be problematic and can result in 
unnecessary follow-up CT, positron emission tomography, or invasive procedures. In 
NLST, 96.4% of the positive results in the low-dose CT group were false positives2,3. 
Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has the potential of optimizing radiologists’ 
workloads. CAD can assist radiologists in detecting lung nodules (CADe) and 
differentiating between benign and malignant nodules (CADx)4-23. CADx is useful for 
assisting radiologists in differentiating between benign and malignant lung nodules6, 
and we expect it to be useful in reducing false positives in lung cancer screening with 
low-dose CT. 
Gradient tree boosting is superior to off-the-shelf classifiers such as random forest or 
support vector machine (SVM)24,25. Because performance of CADx is affected by 
machine learning algorithms, gradient tree boosting may improve the performance of 
CADx. However, to the best of our knowledge, no other study has investigated the 
usefulness of gradient tree boosting in CADx of lung nodules. In our study, we used 
XGBoost as an implementation of gradient tree boosting25 and applied it to CADx 
system of lung nodules. 
It is necessary to optimize parameters of the machine learning algorithm to ensure 
good performance. Grid search has been frequently used for this purpose26. However, 
4 
when the number of parameters is increased, grid search is not feasible because of its 
computational cost. As an alternative to grid search, random search and Bayesian 
optimization were used for parameter optimization27,28. Because XGBoost has many 
parameters, random search and Bayesian optimization are suitable for parameter 
optimization.  
 The purpose of the current study was to develop and evaluate the CADx system, 
focusing on (i) usefulness of XGBoost and (ii) effectiveness of parameter optimization 
using random search and Bayesian optimization. Herein, a hand-crafted imaging 
feature, a variant of the local binary pattern (LBP)11,18,29-31, was used for calculating a 
feature vector that is fed into a machine learning algorithm.  
 
Methods 
This study used anonymized data from a public database. Regulations of Japan did not 
require institutional review board approval for use of a public database.  
 
CT images 
Our CADx system was tested using chest CT images obtained from The Cancer 
Imaging Archive (TCIA). TCIA is an open database of medical images, mainly 
consisting of CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine images that are stored as anonymized 
DICOM data. We used two sets of chest CT images from TCIA; one set from the 
LUNGx Challenge and one from the NSCLC Radiogenomics20,21,32-35. The LUNGx 
Challenge provided 60 test sets of chest CT images with 10 calibration sets. The 60 test 
sets included 73 lung nodules; a list of these nodules is available on the LUNGx 
Challenge website34. Among the 73 nodules from the LUNGx Challenge, 36 were lung 
5 
cancers and 37 were benign. In NSCLC Radiogenomics, each of 26 sets of chest CT 
images included lung cancer. By combining data from LUNGx Challenge with NSCLC 
Radiogenomics, a total of 99 lung nodules (62 lung cancers and 37 benign nodules) 
were used for the development and evaluation of our CADx system.  
 
Image preprocessing 
First, CT images were loaded, and their voxel sizes were resampled into 1 ?  1 ?  1 
mm. Next, the center was determined for each of the 99 nodules. Coordinates of the 
center of the lung nodules were provided via spreadsheet in the LUNGx Challenge and 
utilized here. Conversely, no such information was available for NSCLC 
Radiogenomics. Therefore, the center of the lung nodule was visually validated by two 
board-certified radiologists (M.N. and M.N.). A 64 ?  64 ?  64 3D bounding box was 
set for each nodule, and CT images inside the bounding box were cropped. The cropped 
3D CT images were analyzed as the input to our CADx system. Areas of the CT images 
outside the bounding box were not assessed.  
 
Calculation of a feature vector  
The local binary pattern on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) was used for calculating 
a feature vector11,18,29,30,31. Naïve implementation of 2D LBP was represented as 
follows: 
 ???(?, ?, ?)  =  ? 2?  ×  ?(??)
? ? 1
? = 0  
??  =  ?(?(?, ?, ?))  ?  ?(?), 
 
where x is the center pixel where LBP is calculated; P is the number of samples; n(x, R, 
6 
i) is the ith neighbor pixel around the center pixel x and the distance between the center 
pixel x and the neighbor pixel is R; I(u) is the CT density of pixel u and s(v) is an 
indicator function, where s(v) is 1 if v ? 0 and 0 otherwise. We used a uniform pattern 
and rotation invariant type instead of naïve implementation as naïve implementation 
cannot handle large P values because they make feature vectors too long. Both uniform 
pattern and rotation invariant type can enhance the robustness of LBP as a feature 
vector. To utilize LBP in 3D CT images, LBP-TOP was used in this study. In LBP-TOP, 
2D LBP was calculated on the XY, XZ and YZ planes and the texture information on 
other 3D planes was ignored. Then, the results of 2D LBP on the XY, XZ and YZ planes 
were converted into histograms, which were concatenated. 3D cropped CT images were 
evaluated with uniform pattern and rotation invariant type of LBP-TOP, and 1D feature 
vectors were calculated. 
 
Machine learning algorithm 
Our CADx system was built using SVM or XGBoost24,25. Implementations of SVM and 
XGBoost were freely available. SVM or XGBoost were trained using the feature vector 
obtained by LBP-TOP and its corresponding label. SVM is a widely used machine 
learning algorithm, and we used SVM with kernel trick (radial basis function) in this 
study. XGBoost builds an efficient classifier using gradient tree boosting. Gradient tree 
boosting is invariant to scaling of a feature vector, and it can determine higher-order 
interaction between a feature vector. Gradient tree boosting is trained in an additive 
manner. At each time step t, it grows another new tree to minimize the residual of the 
current model. Formally, the objective function of XGBoost can be described as 
follows: 
7 
 
??  =  ? ? (??, ??
? ? 1  +  ??(??))  + 
?
? = 1 ?(??), 
 
where xi and yi are the feature vector and its label at the i
th instance, ??
? ? 1 is the 
prediction of the ith instance at the t ? 1th iteration, ft is the new tree that classifies the i
th 
instance using xi, l denotes a loss function that measures the difference between the 
label and the prediction at the last step plus the new tree output, and ? is the 
regularization term that penalizes the complexity of the new tree.  
 
Parameters 
The following parameter space was used for parameter optimization. 
 
• For SVM, C and ? were used for controlling SVM with a radial basis function 
kernel. The range of C and ? were as follows: C, 1.0 ?  10?5–1.0 ?  105 and ?, 
1.0 ?  10?5–1.0 ?  105.  
• For XGBoost, parameters and their range were as follows: eta, 0.2–0.6; 
max_depth, 1–13; min_child_weight, 1–10; gamma, 0–1; learning_rate, 1.0 ?  
10?4–1.0 ?  10?1. 
• LBP-TOP has two parameters (R and P). The values of R and P were as follows: 
R = 7, 8 and P = 40, 48. 
 
Parameter optimization 
The parameter space was defined in the previous subsection. Here we denoted the 
8 
parameters as ?. When using machine learning algorithm A (SVM or XGBoost) and the 
parameter ?, we trained A using training data and validated its performance using 
validation data. We used ?(?, ?, ??????, ??????) to denote the validation loss that A 
achieved on validation data Dvalid when A was trained on ? and Dtrain. The parameter 
optimization problem under K-fold cross-validation was then to minimize the black box 
function: 
?(?)  =  
1
?
? ?(?, ?, ??????
? , ??????
? )?? = 1 ,  
where ??????
?  and ??????
?  were training data and validation data of the i-th fold of K-
fold cross-validation, respectively. Bayesian optimization was used for optimizing this 
black box function ?(?) and for searching for the optimal parameter ?. Tree Parzen 
Estimator (TPE) was utilized for solving this problem27. Random search was used to 
compare the performance of TPE. Number of trials for TPE or random search was as 
follows: 10, 100, 200, and 1000. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Leave-one-out cross-validation was used for optimizing and evaluating the performance 
of our CADx system. Validation loss under leave-one-out cross-validation was used for 
parameter optimization. After parameter optimization, probabilistic outputs of our 
CADx system with optimal parameters were analyzed using accuracy and area under the 
curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Classification results of our 
CADx system were output as probabilities of lung cancer to calculate AUC. For each 
number of trial, AUC and accuracy were calculated 10 times, and their averages were 
obtained. An outline of our CADx system is shown in Fig. 1.

Results 
The averaged validation loss, AUC, and accuracy of our CADx system are shown in 
Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 2–4. Supplementary Table S1 shows raw results of validation 
loss, AUC, and accuracy of our CADx system for each setting. Tables 1 and 2 show the 
averages of the raw results listed in Supplementary Table S1. Comparing the results 
depicted in Tables 1 and 2, XGBoost was generally superior to SVM. According to 
Table 1, the best averaged AUC of SVM was 0.850 when using TPE and number of 
trials = 1000. Table 2 shows that the best averaged AUC of XGBoost was 0.896 when 
using TPE and number of trials = 1000. According to Supplementary Table S1, the best 
AUC and accuracy of SVM was 0.855 and 0.834, respectively, and the best AUC and 
accuracy of XGBoost was 0.903 and 0.859, respectively. In XGBoost, the averaged 
AUC of TPE was better than that of random search when the number of trials was 100, 
200, or 1000. In SVM, the averaged AUC of TPE was better than that of the random 
search when the number of trials was 100. However, when the number of trials was 10, 
the difference of the averaged AUC was minimal between random search and TPE in 
SVM and XGBoost. In addition, in SVM, the difference of averaged AUC was minimal 
between random search and TPE when the number of trials was 200 or 1000.  
 
Discussion 
In this study, we used two different sets of CT images for evaluating our CADx system; 
one set from the LUNGx Challenge and the other from the NSCLC Radiogenomics. The 
results of our CADx system show the following two main points; (i) XGBoost was 
better than SVM, and (ii) parameter optimization with TPE was better than that with 
10 
random search. Using XGBoost and TPE, the best averaged AUC under leave-one-out 
cross-validation was 0.896 (the best AUC under leave-one-out cross-validation was 
0.903).  
Armato et al. performed an observer study using the 73 lung nodules of LUNGx 
Challenge, and the observer study included six radiologists. The results showed that 
AUC values of the six radiologists ranged from 0.70 to 0.8521. Although results of our 
CADx system were obtained using two sets of CT images (LUNGx Challenge and 
NSCLC Radiogenomics), we speculated that the diagnostic accuracy of our CADx 
system was comparable to that of the radiologists with respect to classifying lung 
nodules. Our CADx system might overfit the dataset of the current study. However, we 
speculated that the possibility of overfitting was not so high because this dataset 
consisted of two different sets of CT images, and the conditions and parameters of the 
images were variable (i.e. variability in use of contrast material and thickness of CT 
images). 
The previous study shows that AUC value of CADx system was more than 0.8 by 
using the 73 lung nodules of LUNGx Challenge and SVM with a linear kernel11. 
Because of differences in CT images, quality of labels, and kernel type of SVM, it is 
difficult to precisely compare the diagnostic accuracy of the CADx system between the 
current study and the previous study. However, the diagnostic accuracy of our CADx 
system using SVM might be comparable to that of the previous study. 
A few previous studies have utilized XGBoost for developing a clinical model. One 
study used XGBoost for classifying symptom severity based on text information in the 
form of psychiatrist notes36. Another study showed the usefulness of XGBoost for 
differentiation between subjects with epilepsy and healthy subjects using patients’ 
11 
cerebral activity assessed by functional MRI37. In conjunction with the results of these 
studies, we found that XGBoost was useful for developing an efficient and reliable 
clinical model. Although SVM was widely used as a machine learning algorithm in 
CADx, in our study, AUC of CADx using XGBoost was better than that using SVM. A 
prime reason for the superiority of XGBoost to SVM is invariant to scaling of a feature 
vector. As well-known kernels for SVM, such as radial basis function and linear kernels, 
are scale dependent, the output value of SVM is affected by scaling of a feature vector.  
 Previous studies have shown that Bayesian optimization was useful in several 
domains of clinical application38-41. The results of the current study are compatible with 
those of the previous studies. Figures 2–4 show that, in general, TPE is better than 
random search for optimizing parameters in SVM and XGBoost. However, when the 
number of trials was 10, the difference in performance between TPE and random search 
was minimal. This result suggests that the small number of trials (10) hindered 
parameter optimization of SVM and XGBoost. When the number of trials was 200 or 
1000 in SVM, the difference in performance between random search and TPE was also 
minimal. Because parameter space of SVM was narrower than that of XGBoost in the 
current study, we surmised that both random search and TPE could almost fully 
optimize parameters and the difference in performance may be minimal. 
 There were several limitations to our study. First, the number of lung nodules was 
relatively small. Comparing the results of the current study and those of Armato et al.21, 
we theorized that the diagnostic accuracy of our CADx system was comparable to that 
of radiologists for classifying lung nodules. However, this speculation might be 
optimistic as there is a possibility that our CADx system overfitted the dataset of the 
current study. Future studies should be conducted using a large number of lung nodules 
12 
to prevent overfitting and evaluate the generalizability of our CADx system. Second, 
this study focused on the investigation of technical usefulness of XGBoost and 
Bayesian optimization from the viewpoint of CADx of lung nodules, and we ignored 
the clinical usefulness of our CADx system. Because the results of our study showed 
that the diagnostic ability of our CADx system may be comparable to that of 
radiologists, we expect that our CADx system will be useful for classifying lung 
nodules in a practical clinical setting. Third, the parameter space was relatively limited 
in this study. The parameters of our study were divided into two types: the parameter of 
the machine learning algorithm (i.e. C for SVM and eta for XGBoost) and the parameter 
of feature vectors (R and P of LBP). Because the results of parameter optimization were 
not stable when the parameter space of feature vectors was wide, we restricted the 
parameter space of feature vectors in our study. Last, we did not compare our CADx 
system with CADx using deep learning. Results of recent studies suggest that deep 
learning is superior to conventional machine learning. Therefore, our CADx system 
might be inferior to a CADx system with deep learning. We plan to develop a CADx 
system with deep learning and will use TPE for parameter optimization of deep learning 
in a future study.  
In conclusion, XGBoost was better than SVM for classifying lung nodules. For 
optimizing parameters of both SVM and XGBoost, Bayesian optimization was more 
efficient than random search. Although our results were preliminary, the diagnostic 
accuracy of our CADx system may be comparable to that of radiologists for classifying 
lung nodules.
