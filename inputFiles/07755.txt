Gait Recognition from Motion Capture Data
MICHAL BALAZIA and PETR SOJKA, Masaryk University, Czech Republic
Gait recognition from motion capture data, as a pattern classification discipline, can be improved by the use of
machine learning. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art with a statistical approach for extracting robust
gait features directly from raw data by a modification of Linear Discriminant Analysis with Maximum Margin
Criterion. Experiments on the CMU MoCap database show that the suggested method outperforms thirteen
relevant methods based on geometric features and a method to learn the features by a combination of Principal
Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. The methods are evaluated in terms of the distribution
of biometric templates in respective feature spaces expressed in a number of class separability coefficients
and classification metrics. Results also indicate a high portability of learned features, that means, we can
learn what aspects of walk people generally differ in and extract those as general gait features. Recognizing
people without needing group-specific features is convenient as particular people might not always provide
annotated learning data. As a contribution to reproducible research, our evaluation framework and database
have been made publicly available. This research makes motion capture technology directly applicable for
human recognition.

1 INTRODUCTION
From the surveillance perspective, gait pattern biometrics is appealing because it can be performed
at a distance and without body-invasive equipment or the need for the subject’s cooperation.
This allows data acquisition without a subject’s consent. As the data are collected with a high
participation rate and the subjects are not expected to claim their identities, the trait is employed
for identification rather than for authentication.
Motion capture technology acquires video clips of individuals and generates structured motion
data. The format maintains an overall structure of the human body and holds estimated 3D positions
of the main anatomical landmarks as the person moves. These so-called motion capture data
(MoCap) can be collected online by RGB-D sensors such as Microsoft Kinect, Asus Xtion or Vicon.
To visualize motion capture data (see Figure 1), a simplified stick figure representing the human
skeleton (a graph of joints connected by bones) can be automatically recovered from the values of
body point spatial coordinates. With recent rapid improvements in MoCap sensor accuracy, we
foresee an affordable MoCap technology [21] that can identify people from MoCap data.

Seven selected video frames of a walk sequence contain 3D spatial coordinates of each joint in time.
The goal of this work is to present a method for learning robust gait features from raw MoCap
data. A collection of extracted features builds a gait template that serves as the walker’s signature.
Templates are stored in a central database. Recognition of a person involves capturing their walk
sample, extracting gait features to compose a template, and finally querying this database for a set of
similar templates to report the most likely identity. The similarity of the two templates is expressed
in a single number computed by a similarity/distance function.
Related work is outlined in Section 2 and our methods are described in detail in Section 3. We
provide a thorough evaluation of a number of competitive MoCap-based gait recognition methods
on a benchmark database and framework described in Section 4.1. Two setups of data separation
into learning and evaluation parts are presented in 4.2, together with several metrics used for
thorough evaluation. Results are presented and discussed in Section 4.3.
2 RELATEDWORK
Human gait has been an active subject of study in physical medicine (detection of gait abnormalit-
ies [13, 18] and disorders caused by stroke or cerebral palsy [25]), sport (gait regulation [41]), or
sociology (age and gender classification [33] or attractiveness evaluation [22]) for a long time. In-
spired by medical studies of Murray [34], a psychological research of Johansson [24] and by Cutting
and Kozlowski [17] conducted experiments about how participants are able to recognize pedestrians
from simply observing the 2D gait pattern generated by light bulbs attached to several joints over
their body. These experiments proved that the gait is personally unique and can be potentially used
for biometric recognition. The main challenges from the perspective of biometric security [11]
are (1) to detect gait cycles in long video footage; (2) to recognize registered participants by their
biometric samples; and (3) to retrieve relevant biometric samples from large databases.
Many research groups investigate the discrimination power of gait pattern and develop models
of human walk for applications in the automatic recognition from MoCap data of walking people. A
number of MoCap-based gait recognition methods have been introduced in the past few years and
new ones continue to emerge. In order to move forward with the wealth and scope of competitive
research, it is necessary to compare the innovative approaches with the state-of-the-art and evaluate
them against established evaluation metrics on a benchmark database. New frameworks and
databases have been developed recently [14, 26].
Over the past few years, most of the introduced gait features are on a geometric basis. They
typically combine static body parameters (bone lengths, person’s height) with dynamic gait features
such as step length, walk speed, joint angles and inter-joint distances, along with various statistics
(mean, standard deviation or local/global extremes) of their signals. We are particularly focused on
2
the dynamic parameters. By our definition, gait is a dynamic behavioral trait. Static body parameters
are not associated with gait, however, they can be used as another biometric.
What follows is a detailed specification of the thirteen gait features extraction methods that we
have reviewed in our work to date. Since the idea behind each method has some potential, we
have implemented each of them for direct comparison.
• AhmedF by Ahmed et al. [1] chooses 20 joint relative distance signals and 16 joint relative
angle signals across the whole body, compared using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
• AhmedM by Ahmed et al. [2] extracts the mean, standard deviation and skew during one
gait cycle of horizontal distances (projected on the Z axis) between feet, knees, wrists and
shoulders, and mean and standard deviation during one gait cycle of vertical distances
(Y coordinates) of head, wrists, shoulders, knees and feet, and finally the mean area during
one gait cycle of the triangle of root and two feet.
• AliS by Ali et al. [3] measures the mean areas during one gait cycle of lower limb triangles.
• AnderssonVO by Andersson and Araujo [4] calculates gait attributes as mean and standard
deviation during one gait cycle of local extremes of the signals of lower body angles, step
length as a maximum of feet distance, stride length as a length of two steps, cycle time and
velocity as a ratio of stride length and cycle time. In addition, they extract the mean and
standard deviation during one gait cycle of each bone length, and height as the sum of the
bone lengths between head and root plus the averages of the bone lengths between root and
both feet.
• BallA by Ball et al. [9] measures mean, standard deviation and maximum during one gait
cycle of lower limb angle pairs: upper leg relative to the Y axis, lower leg relative to the upper
leg, and the foot relative to the Z axis.
• DikovskiB by Dikovski et al. [19] selects the mean during one gait cycle of step length,
height, all bone lengths, then mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and mean
difference of subsequent frames during one gait cycle of all major joint angles, and the angle
between the lines of the shoulder joints and the hip joints.
• JiangS by Jiang et al. [23] measures angle signals between the Y axis and four major lower
body (thigh and calf) bones. The signals are compared using the DTW.
• KrzeszowskiT by Krzeszowski et al. [28] observes the signals of rotations of eight major
bones (humerus, ulna, thigh and calf) around all three axes, the person’s height and step
length. These signals are compared using the DTW distance function.
• KwolekB by Kwolek et al. [30] processes signals of bone angles around all axes, the person’s
height and step length. The gait cycles are normalized to 30 frames.
• NareshKumarMS by Naresh Kumar and Venkatesh Babu [29] is an interesting approach
that extracts all joint trajectories around all three axes and compares gait templates by a
distance function of their covariance matrices.
• PreisJ by Preis et al. [35] takes height, length of legs, torso, both lower legs, both thighs,
both upper arms, both forearms, step length and speed.
• SedmidubskyJ by Sedmidubsky et al. [36] concludes that only the two shoulder-hand signals
are discriminatory enough to be used for recognition. These temporal data are compared
using the DTW distance function.
• SinhaA by Sinha et al. [37] combines all features of BallA and PreisJ with mean areas during
one gait cycle of upper body and lower body, then mean, standard deviation and maximum
distances during one gait cycle between the centroid of the upper body polygon and the
centroids of four limb polygons.

The aforementioned features are schematic and human-interpretable, which is convenient for
visualizations and for intuitive understanding of the models, but unnecessary for automatic gait
recognition. Instead, to refrain from ad-hoc schemes and to explore beyond the limits of human
interpretability, we prefer learning gait features that maximally separate the identity classes in
the feature space. The features calculated by statistical observation of large amounts of data are
expected to have a much higher discriminative potential, which will be the subject of experimental
evaluation in Section 4.
Methods for 2D gait recognition extensively use machine learning models for extracting gait
features, such as principal component analysis and multi-scale shape analysis [15], genetic al-
gorithms and kernel principal component analysis [39], radial basis function neural networks [42],
or convolutional neural networks [12]. All of these and many other models can be reasonably
utilized in 3D gait recognition as well. The following section provides a scheme for learning the
features directly from raw data by (i) a modification of Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis with
Maximum Margin Criterion and (ii) a combination of Principal Component Analysis and Linear
Discriminant Analysis.
3 LEARNING GAIT FEATURES
In statistical pattern recognition, reducing space dimensionality is a common technique to overcome
class estimation problems. Classes are discriminated by projecting high-dimensional input data
onto low-dimensional sub-spaces by linear transformations with the goal of maximizing class
separability. We are interested in finding an optimal feature space where a gait template is close to
those of the same walker and far from those of different walkers.
Let the model of a human body have J joints and all NL learning samples of CL walkers be
linearly normalized to their average length T . Labeled learning data in a sample (measurement)
space have the form GL = {(gn , ?n)}NLn=1 where
gn =
[
[?1 (1) · · · ? J (1)] · · · [?1 (T ) · · · ? J (T )]
]? (1)
is a gait sample (one gait cycle) in which ?j (t) ? R3 are 3D spatial coordinates of joint j ? {1, . . . , J }
at time t ? {1, . . . ,T } normalized with respect to the person’s position and walk direction. See
that GL has dimensionality D = 3JT . Each learning sample falls strictly into one of the learning
identity classes {Ic }CLc=1 labeled by ?n . A class Ic ? GL has Nc samples. The classes are complete
and mutually exclusive. We say that samples (gn , ?n) and (gn?, ?n?) share a common walker if and
only if they belong to the same class, i.e., (gn , ?n) , (gn?, ?n?) ? Ic ? ?n = ?n? . For the whole labeled
data, we denote the between- and within-class and total scatter matrices

We measure class separability of a given feature space by a representation of the Maximum
Margin Criterion (MMC) [27, 31] used by the Vapnik’s Support Vector Machines (SVM) [40] which
maximizes the sum of 12CL(CL ? 1) between-class margins

(4)
Since tr (?B) measures the overall variance of the class mean vectors, a large one implies that the
class mean vectors scatter in a large space. On the other hand, a small tr (?W) implies that classes
have a small spread. Thus, a large J indicates that samples are close to each other if they share
a common walker but are far from each other if they are performed by different walkers. Extracting
features, that is, transforming the input data in the sample space into a feature space of higher
J , can be used to link new observations of walkers more successfully.
Feature extraction is given by a linear transformation (feature) matrix ? ? RD×D? from a D-
dimensional sample space G = {gn}Nn=1 of not necessarily labeled gait samples to a D?-dimensional
feature space G? =
{
g?n
}N
n=1 of gait templates where D? < D and each gait sample gn is transformed
into a gait template g?n = ??gn . The objective is to learn a transform ? that maximizes MMC
in the feature space
J (?) = tr
(
?? (?B ? ?W)?
)
. (5)
Once the transformation is found, all measured samples are transformed into templates (in the
feature space) along with the class means and covariances. The templates are compared by the
Mahalanobis distance function
??
(?
gn , g?n?
)
=
?(?
gn ? g?n?
)? ???1T (?gn ? g?n? ) . (6)
We show that a solution to the optimization problem in Equation (5) can be obtained by eigen-
decomposition of the matrix ?B ? ?W. An important property to notice about the objective J (?)
is that it is invariant w.r.t. rescalings ? ? ??. Hence, we can always choose ? = f1? · · · ?fD? such
that f?
d?
fd? = 1, since it is a scalar itself. For this reason we can reduce the problem of maximizing
5
J (?) into the constrained optimization problem

(?B ? ?W) fd?
subject to f?

fd? ? 1 = 0 ?d? ? {1, . . . , D?}.

To solve the above optimization problem, let us consider the Lagrangian

fd? , ?d?
)
=
D??
d?=1
f?
d?
(?B ? ?W) fd? ? ?d?
(
f?

)
(8)
with multipliers ?d? . To find the maximum, we derive it with respect to fd? and equate it to zero
?L
(
fd? , ?d?
)
?fd?
=
(
(?B ? ?W) ? ?d? I
)
fd? = 0 (9)
which leads to
(?B ? ?W) fd? = ?d? fd? (10)
where ?d? are the eigenvalues of ?B ? ?W and fd? are the corresponding eigenvectors. Putting it
all together,
(?B ? ?W)? = ?? (11)
where ? = diag
(
?1, . . . , ?D?
)
is the eigenvalue matrix. Therefore,
J (?) = tr

?? (?B ? ?W)?

?d? = tr (?) (12)
is maximized when ? has D? largest eigenvalues and ? contains the corresponding eigenvectors.
In the following we discuss how to calculate the eigenvectors of ?B ? ?W and to determine an
optimal dimensionality D? of the feature space. Rewrite ?B ? ?W = 2?B ? ?T. Note that the null
space of ?T is a subspace of that of ?B since the null space of ?T is the common null space of ?B
and ?W. Thus, we can simultaneously diagonalize ?B and ?T to some ? and I
???B? = ?
???T? = I
(13)
with the D × rank (?T) eigenvector matrix
? = ???
1
2 ? (14)
where ? and ? are the eigenvector and corresponding eigenvalue matrices of ?T, respectively, and
? is the eigenvector matrix of ??1/2???B???1/2. To calculate ?, we use a fast two-step algorithm
in virtue of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD expresses a real r × s matrix A as a product
A = UDV? where D is a diagonal matrix with decreasing non-negative entries, and U and V
are r ×min {r , s} and s ×min {r , s} eigenvector matrices of AA? and A?A, respectively, and the
6
non-vanishing entries of D are square roots of the non-zero corresponding eigenvalues of both
AA? and A?A. See that ?T and ?B can have the forms
?T = XX? where X =
1
?
NL
[
(g1 ? µ) · · ·
(
gNL ? µ
) ]
and
?B = ??? where ? =
[
(µ1 ? µ) · · ·
(
µCL ? µ
) ]
,
(15)
respectively. Hence, we can obtain the eigenvectors ? and the corresponding eigenvalues ? of
?T through the SVD of X and analogically ? of ??1/2???B???1/2 through the SVD of ??1/2???.
The columns of ? are clearly the eigenvectors of 2?B ? ?T with the corresponding eigenvalues
2? ? I. Therefore, to constitute the transform ? by maximizing the MMC, we should choose the
eigenvectors in ? that correspond to the eigenvalues of at least 1/2 in ?. Note that ? contains at
most rank (?B) = CL ? 1 positive eigenvalues, which gives an upper bound on the feature space
dimensionality D?.
We found inspiration in the Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [20] that uses Fisher’s
criterion
J (?LDA) = tr
(
??LDA?B?LDA
??LDA?W?LDA
)
. (16)
However, since the rank of ?W is at most NL ?CL , it is a singular (non-invertible) matrix if NL is
less than D +CL , or, analogously might be unstable if NL ? D. Small sample size is a substantial
difficulty as it is necessary to calculate ??1W . To alleviate this, the measured data can be first projected
to a lower dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resulting in a two-stage
PCA+LDA feature extraction technique [10] originally introduced for face recognition
J (?PCA) = tr
(
??PCA?T?PCA
)
J (?LDA) = tr
( ??LDA??PCA?B?PCA?LDA
??LDA?
?
PCA?W?PCA?LDA
) (17)
and the final transform is ? = ?PCA?LDA. Given that there are D principal components, then
regardless of the dimensionality D there are at least D + 1 independent data points. Thus, if the
D ×D matrix ??PCA?W?PCA is estimated from NL ?CL independent observations and providing the
CL ? D ? NL ?CL , we can always invert ??PCA?W?PCA and in this way obtain the LDA estimate.
Note that this method is sub-optimal for multi-class problems [32] as PCA keeps at most NL ?CL
principal components whereas at least NL ?1 of them are necessary in order not to lose information.
PCA+LDA in this form has been used for silhouette-based (2D) gait recognition by Su et al. [38]
and is included in our experiments with MoCap (3D).
On given labeled learning data GL , Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 [5, 6] provided below are
efficient ways of learning the transforms ? for MMC and PCA+LDA, respectively.

system. People wear a black jumpsuit with 41 markers taped on. The tracking space of 30m2 is
surrounded by 12 cameras with a sampling rate of 120Hz at heights ranging from 2 to 4 meters
above ground thereby creating a video surveillance environment. Motion videos are triangulated
to get highly accurate 3D data in the form of relative body point coordinates (with respect to
the root joint) in each video frame and are stored in the standard ASF/AMC data format. Each
registered participant is assigned with their respective skeleton described in an ASF file. Motions
in the AMC files store bone rotational data, which is interpreted as instructions about how the
associated skeleton deforms over time.
These MoCap data, however, contain skeleton parameters pre-calibrated by the CMU staff. Skel-
etons are unique to each walker and even a trivial skeleton check could result in 100% recognition.
In order to fairly use the collected data, a prototypical skeleton is constructed and used to represent
bodies of all subjects, shrouding the skeleton parameters. Assuming that all walking individuals are
physically identical disables the skeleton check from being a potentially unfair classifier. Moreover,
this is a skeleton-robust solution as all bone rotational data are linked to one specific skeleton. To
obtain realistic parameters, it is calculated as the mean of all skeletons in the provided ASF files.
The raw data are in the form of bone rotations or, if combined with the prototypical skeleton, 3D
joint coordinates. The bone rotational data are taken from the AMC files without any pre-processing.
We calculate the joint coordinates using the bone rotational data and the prototypical skeleton.
One cannot directly use raw values of joint coordinates, as they refer to absolute positions in the
tracking space, and not all potential methods are invariant to a person’s position or walk direction.
To ensure such invariance, the center of the coordinate system is moved to the position of root
joint ?root (t) = [0, 0, 0]? for each time t and the axes are adjusted to the walker’s perspective: the
X axis is from right (negative) to left (positive), the Y axis is from down (negative) to up (positive),
and the Z axis is from back (negative) to front (positive). In the AMC file structure notation it is
8
achieved by setting the root translation and rotation to zero (root 0 0 0 0 0 0) in all frames
of all motion sequences.
Since the general motion database contains all motion types, we extracted a number of sub-
motions that represent gait cycles. First, an exemplary gait cycle was identified, and clean gait
cycles were then filtered out using a threshold for their DTW distance on bone rotations in time.
The distance threshold was explicitly set low enough so that even the least similar sub-motions still
semantically represent gait cycles. Setting this threshold higher might also qualify sub-motions that
do not resemble gait cycles anymore. Finally, subjects that contributed with less than 10 samples
were excluded. The final database [8] has 54 walking subjects that performed 3,843 samples in
total, resulting in an average of about 71 samples per subject.
As a contribution to reproducible research, we release our database and framework to improve
the development, evaluation and comparison of methods for gait recognition from MoCap data.
They are intended also for our fellow researchers and reviewers to reproduce the results of our
experiments. Our recent paper [7] provides amanual and comments on reproducing the experiments.
With this manual, a reader should be able to reproduce the evaluation and to use the implementation
in their own application. The source codes and data are available online at our research group web
page [8] with link to our departmental Git repository.
The evaluation framework comprises (i) source codes of the state-of-the-art human-interpretable
geometric features that we have reviewed in our work to date as well as own our two approaches
where gait features are learned by MMC (see Algorithm 1) and by PCA+LDA (see Algorithm 2),
the Random method (no features and random classifier), and the Raw method (raw data and DTW
distance function). Depending on whether the raw data are in the form of bone rotations or joint
coordinates, the methods are referred to with BR or JC subscripts, respectively. The framework
includes (ii) a mechanism for evaluating four class separability coefficients of feature space and
four classifier performance metrics. It also contains (iii) a tool for learning a custom classifier and
for classifying a custom probe on a custom gallery. We provide (iv) an experimental database along
with source codes for its extraction from the CMU MoCap database.
4.2 Evaluation Setup and Metrics
In the following, we introduce two setups of data separation: homogeneous and heterogeneous.
The homogeneous setup learns the transformation matrix on a fraction of samples of CL identities
and is evaluated on templates derived from the remaining samples of the same CE = CL identities.
The heterogeneous setup learns the transform on all samples of CL identities and is evaluated
on all templates derived from all samples of other CE identities. An abstraction of this concept is
depicted in Figure 2. Note that in heterogeneous setup no walker identity is ever used for both
learning and evaluation at the same time.
A use of the homogeneous setup can be any system to recognize people that cooperated at
learning the features. For example, a small company entrance authentication where all employees
cooperated to register. MoCap data of each employee’s gait pattern can be registered along with
a picture of their face. On the other hand, the heterogeneous setup can be used at person re-
identification. During video surveillance, new identities can appear on the fly and labeled data for
all the people encountered may not always be available. In this scenario, forensic investigators
may ask for tracking the suspects.
The homogeneous setup is parametrized by a single numberCL = CE of learning-and-evaluation
identity classes, whereas the heterogeneous setup has the form (CL,CE ). This parametrization
specifies how many learning and how many evaluation identity classes are randomly selected
from the database. The evaluation of each setup is repeated 3 times, selecting new random identity
classes each time and reporting the average result.

Fig. 2. Abstraction of the concept of homogeneous and heterogeneous setups. Consider a matrix (visualized
as a rectangle) of all database samples where each row contains samples of one identity class. The homo-
geneous setup separates all identities into 1/3 learning samples and 2/3 evaluation samples (left), whereas the
heterogeneous setup takes 1/3 learning identities and 2/3 evaluation identities with all their samples (right).
Setting the sizes of learning and evaluation parts is a subject of setup configuration.
In both setups, the class separability coefficients are calculated directly on the full evaluation
part whereas the classification metrics are estimated with the 10-fold cross-validation taking one
dis-labeled fold as a testing set and the other nine labeled folds as gallery. Test templates are
classified by the winner-takes-all strategy, in which a test template g?test gets assigned with the
label ?
argmini ??
(?
gtest, g?galleryi
) of the gallery’s closest identity class.
What follows is a list of evaluation metrics. Recognition rate is often perceived as the ultimate
qualitative measure; however, it is more explanatory to include an evaluation in terms of class
separability of the feature space. The class separability measures give an estimate of the recognition
potential of the extracted features and do not reflect eventual combination with an unsuitable
classifier:
• Davies-Bouldin Index: DBI
DBI =

is the average distance of all elements in identity class Ic to its
centroid, and analogically for ?c ? . Templates of low intra-class distances and of high inter-class
distances have a low DBI.

with ?c from the above DBI. Since this criterion seeks classes with high intra-class similarity and
low inter-class similarity, a high DI is more desirable.

are appropriately separated.

A high FDR is preferred for seeking classes with low intra-class sparsity and high inter-class
sparsity.
Apart from analyzing the distribution of templates in the feature space, it is schematic to combine
the features with a rank-based classifier and to evaluate the system based on distance distribution
with respect to a query. For obtaining a more applied performance evaluation, we evaluate:
• Cumulative Match Characteristic: CMC
Sequence of Rank-k (for k on X axis from 1 up to CE ) recognition rates (Y axis) to measure ranking
capabilities of a recognition method. Its headline Rank-1 is the Correct Classification Rate (CCR).
• False Accept Rate vs. False Reject Rate: FAR/FRR
Two sequences of the error rates (Y axis) as functions of the discrimination threshold (X axis). Each
method has a value e of this threshold giving Equal Error Rate (EER=FAR=FRR).
• Receiver Operating Characteristic: ROC
Sequence of True Accept Rate (TAR) and False Accept Rate with a varied discrimination threshold.
For a given threshold, the system signalizes both TAR (Y axis) and FAR (X axis). The value of Area
Under Curve (AUC) is computed as the integral of the ROC curve.
• Recall vs. Precision: RCL/PCN
Sequence of the rates with a varied discrimination threshold. For a given threshold the system
signals both RCL (X axis) and PCN (Y axis). The value ofMean Average Precision (MAP) is computed
as the area under the RCL/PCN curve.
These measures reflect how class-separated the feature space is, how often the walk pattern of a
person is classified correctly and how difficult it is to confuse different people. They do not, in fact,
provide complementary information, although a quality evaluation framework should be able to
evaluate the most popular measures. Different applications use different evaluation measures. For
example, a hotel lobby authentication system could use a high Rank-3 at the CMC, while a city-level
person tracking system is likely to need the ROC curve leaning towards the upper left corner.
Finally, the evaluation incorporates two scalability measures: average distance computation time
(DCT) in milliseconds and average template dimensionality (TD).
4.3 Results
In this section we provide comparative evaluation results of the feature extraction methods in terms
of evaluation metrics defined in Section 4.2. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluate all methods
on the same experimental database and framework described in Section 4.1. Table 1 presents
the implementation details of all the methods and the results of class separability coefficients,
classification metrics and scalability.
The goal of the MMC-based learning is to find a linear discriminant that maximizes the misclassi-
fication margin. This optimization technique appears to be more effective than designing geometric
gait features. A variety of class-separability coefficients and classification metrics allows insights
from different statistical perspectives. The results in Table 1 indicate that the proposed MMCBR

method (on bone rotational data) is a leading concept for rank-based classifier systems: highest SC
and AUC, lowest EER, and competitive DBI, DI, FDR, CCR and MAP. In terms of recognition rate,
the MMC method was only outperformed by the Raw method, which is implemented here as a
form of baseline. We interpret the high scores as a sign of robustness.
Apart from the performance merits, the MMCmethod is also efficient: relatively low-dimensional
templates and Mahalanobis distance ensure fast distance computations and thus contribute to high
scalability. Note that even if the Raw method has some of the best results, it can hardly be used in
practice due to its extreme consumption of time and space resources. On the other hand, Random
has no features but cannot be considered a serious recognition method. To illustrate the evaluation
time, calculating the distance matrix (a matrix of distances between all evaluation templates) took
a couple minutes for the MMC method, almost nothing for the Random method, and more than
two weeks for the Raw method. The learning time of the MMC and PCA+LDA methods increases
with the number of learning samples NL (counting ?W and ?T matrices); however, this is not an
issue in the field of gait recognition as training the models suffers from the opposite problem,
undersampling.
To reproduce the experiments in Table 1, instructions to follow are to be found at [8]. Please note
that some methods are rather slow – total evaluation times (learning included) in the last column
were measured on a computer with Intel® Xeon® CPU E5-2650 v2 @ 2.60GHz and 256GB RAM.
An additional experiment was carried out with the traditional 10-fold cross-validation in which
gait cycles of a common walk sequence are always kept together in the same fold. This is to prevent
a situation in which two consecutive gait cycles are split between testing and training folds which
would cause a potential overtraining. The classification metrics of methods include CCR, EER, AUC,
MAP, and the CMC curve up to Rank-10. Displayed in Table 2, the results suggest that the methods
based on machine learning outperform the methods of hand-designed features in terms of all
measured metrics. Note that the results are slightly worse than those in Table 1 due to avoiding the
overtraining cases and that the order of the tested methods is preserved. We interpret this order as
a demonstrative result of comparison of all tested methods based on their classification potential.
Finally, the experiments A, B, C, D described below compare the homogeneous and hetero-
geneous setup and examine how quality of the system in the heterogeneous setup improves with
an increased number of learning identities. The main idea is to show that we can learn what aspects
of walk people generally differ in and extract those as general gait features. Recognizing people
without needing group-specific features is convenient as particular people might not always provide
annotated learning data. Results are illustrated in Figure 3 and in Figure 4.
A homogeneous setup with CL = CE ? {2, . . . , 27};
B heterogeneous setup with CL = CE ? {2, . . . , 27};
C heterogeneous setup with CL ? {2, . . . , 27} and CE = 27;
D heterogeneous setup with CL ? {2, . . . , 27} and CE = 27 ?CL .
ExperimentsA and B compare homogeneous and heterogeneous setups by measuring the drop in
the quality measures on an identical number of learning and evaluation identities (CL = CE ). Please
note that based on Section 4.1 our database has 54 identity classes in total and they can be split into
the learning and evaluation parts in the numbers of at most (27, 27). Top plot in Figure 3 shows the
values of DBI and CCR metrics in both alternatives, which not only appear comparable but also
in some configurations the heterogeneous setup has an even higher CCR. Bottom plot expresses
heterogeneous setup as a percentage of the homogeneous setup in each of the particular metrics.
Here we see that with raising number of identities the heterogeneous setup approaches 100% of
the homogeneous setup. Therefore, the gait features learned by the introduced MMC method are
walker-independent, which means that they can be learned on anybody.

Experiments C and D investigate the impact of the number of learning identities in the hetero-
geneous setup. Experiment D has only been evaluated up until (27, 27) as results with a learning
part larger than an evaluation part would be insignificant. As can be seen in Figure 4, the perform-
ance grows quickly on the first configurations with very few learning identities, which we can
interpret as an analogy to the Pareto (80–20) principle. Specifically, the results of experiment C
say that 8 learning identities achieve almost the same performance (66.78 DBI and 0.902 CCR) as if
they had been learned on 27 identities (68.32 DBI and 0.947 CCR). The outcome of experiment D
indicates a similar growth of performance and we see that 14 identities can be enough to learn the
transformation matrix to distinguish 40 completely different people (0.904 CCR).
5 CONCLUSION
A common practice in state-of-the-art MoCap-based human identification is designing geometric
gait features by hand. However, the field of pattern recognition has not recently advanced to a point
where best results are frequently obtained using a machine learning approach. Finding optimal
features for MoCap-based gait recognition is no exception. This work introduces the concept of
learning robust and discriminative features directly from raw MoCap data by a modification of the
Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis with Maximum Margin Criterion and by combining Principal
Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis, both with the goal of maximal separation
of identity classes, avoiding the potential singularity problem caused by undersampling. Instead
of instinctively drawing ad-hoc features, these methods are computed from a much larger space
beyond the limits of human interpretability. The collection of features learned by MMC achieves

leading scores in four class separability coefficients and therefore has a great potential for gait
recognition applications. This is demonstrated on our extracted and normalized MoCap database
of 54 walkers with 3,843 gait cycles by outperforming other 13 methods in numerous evaluation
metrics. MMC is suitable for optimizing gait features; however, our future work will continue with
research on further potential optimality criteria and multi-linear machine learning approaches.
The second contribution lies in showing the possibility of building a representation on a problem
and using it on another (related) problem. Simulations on the CMU MoCap database show that our
approach is able to build robust feature spaces without pre-registering and labeling all potential
walkers. In fact, we can take different people (experiments A and B) and use just a fraction of them
(experiments C and D). We have observed that already on 5 identities the heterogeneous evaluation
setup exceeds 95% of the homogeneous setup and improves with an increasing volume of identities.
This means that one does not have to rely on the availability of all walkers for learning; instead,
the features can be learned on anybody. The CCR of over 90% when learning on 14 identities and
evaluating on other 40 identities shows that an MMC-based system once learned on a fixed set
of walker identities can be used to distinguish many more additional walkers. This is particularly
important for a system that supports video surveillance applications where the encountered walkers
never supply labeled data. Multiple occurrences of individual walkers can now be linked together
even without knowing their actual identities.
In the name of reproducible research, our third contribution is the provision of the evaluation
framework and database. All our data and source codes have been made available [8] under the

which grant free use and allow for experimental evaluation. We hope that they will contribute to
a smooth development and evaluation of further novel MoCap-based gait recognition methods. We
encourage all readers and developers of MoCap-based gait recognition methods to contribute to
the framework with new algorithms, data and improvements.
