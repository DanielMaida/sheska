Abstract—Cardiac function is of paramount importance for
both prognosis and treatment of different pathologies such as
mitral regurgitation, ischemia, dyssynchrony and myocarditis.
Cardiac behavior is determined by structural and functional
features. In both cases, the analysis of medical imaging studies
requires to detect and segment the myocardium. Nowadays,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most relevant
and accurate non-invasive diagnostic tools for cardiac structure
and function.
In this work we propose to use a deep learning technique to
assist the automatization of myocardial segmentation in cardiac
MRI. We present several improvements to previous works in this
paper: we propose to use the Jaccard distance as optimization
objective function, we integrate a residual learning strategy into
the code, and we introduce a batch normalization layer to train
the fully convolutional neural network. Our results demonstrate
that this architecture outperforms previous approaches based
on a similar network architecture, and that provides a suitable
approach for myocardial segmentation. Our benchmark shows
that the automatic myocardial segmentation takes less than 22
seg. for a volume of 128 x 128 x 13 pixels in a 3.1 GHz intel core
i7.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantitative characterization of cardiac function is highly
desirable for both prognosis and treatment of different patholo-
gies such as mitral regurgitation, ischemia, dyssynchrony and
myocarditis [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. In particular, cardiac function
is characterized by structural and functional features. These
features can be classified as global or regional, according to
the type of information they provide. One of the most relevant
global structural features are the left ventricular mass (LVM),
the left ventricular volume (LV) and the ejection fraction (EF),
which is directly derived from the LV at end-diastole (ED) and
end-systole (ES). Besides, the most relevant functional features
are those derived from myocardial deformation such as strain
and strain rate. Functional information is commonly presented
according to the 17-segment model proposed by the American
Heart Association (AHA) [6]. In both cases, it is necessary to
detect and segment the myocardium of the left ventricle.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most im-
portant and accurate non-invasive diagnostic tools for imaging
of cardiac structure and function [7]. It is usually considered
as the gold standard for ventricular volume quantification [8].
Chamber segmentation from cardiac MRI datasets is an essen-
tial step for quantification of global features, which involves
the estimation of ventricular volume, ejection fraction, mass
and wall thickness, among others. Manual delineation by ex-
perts is currently the standard clinical practice for performing
chamber segmentation. However, and despite the efforts of
researchers and medical vendors, global quantification and
volumetric analysis still remain time consuming tasks which
heavily rely on user interaction. For example, the time re-
quired to accurately extract the most common volumetric
indices for the left ventricle for a single patient is around
10 minutes [9]. Thus, there is still a significant need for
tools allowing automatic 3D quantification. The main goal
of this work is to provide a suitable and accurate automatic
myocardial segmentation approach for cardiac MRI based on
deep convolutional neural networks [10], [11].
Many different techniques have been applied in the past to
treat the problem of automatic segmentation of the left ven-
tricle. Most of these approaches depend on proper initializa-
tion step [12]. Many model-based left ventricle segmentation
approaches have been studied[13]: active contours [14], level-
set method [15], active shape models and active appearance
models [16], [17]. Unfortunately, all of them have a strong de-
pendence on the initial model placement. In general, improper
initialization leads to unwanted local minima of the objective
function.
In contrast, non model-based approaches to the prob-
lem are expected to have a more robust behavior. Among
these approaches are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
which combine insights from the structure of receptive fields
of the visual system with modern techniques of machine
learning [18]. Several recent studies in computer vision and
pattern recognition highlight the capabilities of these networks
to solve challenging tasks such as classification, segmenta-
tion and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art perfor-
mances [19]. Fully convolutional networks trained end-to-end
have been recently used for medical image segmentation [20],
[21]. These models, which serve as an inspiration for our

work, employ different types of network architectures and
were trained to generate a segmentation mask that delineates
the structures of interest in the image.
One of the main disadvantages of deep neural networks,
such as CNN, is that its training is complicated by the fact
that the distribution of each layer‘s inputs changes along this
process, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This
phenomenon is called internal covariate shift [22]. As the
networks start to converge, a degradation problem occurs: with
increasing network depth, accuracy gets saturated. Unexpect-
edly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting, and adding
more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training
error, as reported [23], [24]. To overcome this problem the
technique of batch normalization has been proposed [25]. This
procedure involves the evaluation of the statistical properties of
the neural activations that are present for a given batch of data
in order to normalize the inputs to any layer to obtain some
desired objective (such as zero mean and unit variance). At
the same time, the architecture is modified in order to prevent
loss of information that could arise from the normalization.
This technique allows to use much higher learning rates and
also acts as regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for
dropout [26].
Another recent performance improvement of deep neural
networks has been achieved by reformulating the layers as
learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs,
instead of learning unreferenced functions [27]. In other
words, the parameters to be determined at a given stage
generate only the difference (or residual) between the objective
function to be learned and some fixed function such as the
identity. It was empirically found that this approach gives rise
to networks that are easier to optimize, which can also gain
accuracy from considerably increased depth [27].
In this work, we analyze the use of these techniques in
the U-net architecture to segment the myocardium of the
left ventricle, similarly as proposed in [21] for studying the
prostate. Unlike previous works, we propose to use the Jaccard
distance [28] as optimization objective and a batch normaliza-
tion layer for the training of the CNN. Results demonstrate that
the proposed model outperforms previous approaches based
on the U-net architecture and provides a suitable approach for
myocardial segmentation.
The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 the U-
net network with residual learning and batch normalization is
introduced. Additionally, the training strategy and the objective
function used for training the CNN is presented. In Section
3, the evaluation of the proposed method in cardiac MRI is
presented. Finally, we present the conclusions in Section 4.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
The present network for myocardial segmentation was
trained and evaluated with the Sunnybrook Cardiac Dataset
(SCD), also known as the 2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle
Segmentation Challenge data [29]. The dataset consists of 45
cine-MRI images from a mix of patients and pathologies:
healthy, hypertrophy, heart failure with infarction and heart
failure without infarction. A subset of this dataset was first
used in the automated myocardium segmentation challenge
from short-axis MRI, held by a MICCAI workshop in 2009.
The whole complete dataset is now available in the Cardiac
Atlas Project database with public domain license1.
The Sunnybrook Cardiac Dataset [29] contains 45 cardiac
cine-MR datasets with expert contours, as part of the clinical
routine. Cine steady state free precession (SSFP) MR short
axis (SAX) images were obtained with a 1.5T GE Signa MRI.
All the images were obtained during 10-15 second breath-
holds with a temporal resolution of 20 cardiac phases over
the heart cycle, and scanned from the ED phase. In these
SAX MR acquisitions, endocardial and epicardial contours
were drawn by an experienced cardiologist in all slices at ED
and ES phases. All the contours were confirmed by another
cardiologist. The manual segmentations will be used as the
ground truth for evaluation purposes. Additionally, a ROI of
128 x 128 pixels with a spatial resolution of 1.36 x 1.36 mm
in the short-axis around the heart was manually selected. The
ROI size was defined by an expert to ensure that the entire
left ventricle was included.
Network architecture
The modified U-net system that we use for myocardial
segmentation, follows a typical encode-decode network archi-
tecture. In this architecture, depicted in Fig. 1, the network
learns how to encode information about features presented
in the training set (left side on Fig. 1). Then, in the decode
path the network learns about the image reconstruction process
from the encoded features learned previously. The specific
feature of the U-net architecture lies on the concatenation
between the output of the encode path, for each level, and
the input of the decoding path (denoted as big gray arrows on
Fig. 1). These concatenations provide the ability to localize
high spatial resolution features to the fully convolutional
network, thus, generating a more precise output based on
this information. As mentioned in [20] this strategy allows
the seamless segmentation of large images by an overlap-
tile strategy. In order to predict the pixels in the border
region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by
the concatenation from the encoding path.
The encoding path consists of the repeated application of
two 3 x 3 convolutions, each followed by a rectified linear
unit (ReLU) as it was originally proposed in [20]. After
performing the convolution, a batch normalization is carried
out to improve the accuracy and reduce learning time. Then, a
residual learning is introduced just before performing the 2 x 2
max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling, in a
similar way as it was proposed in [21]. At each downsampling
step we double the number of feature channels, that is initially
set to 64.
Every step in the decoding path can be seen as the mirrored
step of the encode path, i.e. each step in the decoding path

The arrows denote the different operations according to the legend.
consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a
2 x 2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number
of feature channels, a concatenation with the corresponding
feature map from the encoding path, and two 3 x 3 convo-
lutions, each followed by a ReLU and a batch normalization.
Finally, a residual learning is introduced to get the input of
the next level. At the final layer, a 1 x 1 convolution is carried
out to map the 64 feature maps to the two classes used for
the myocardial segmentation (myocardium and background).
The output of the last layer, after soft-max non-linear function,
represents the likelihood of a pixel belongs to the myocardium
of the left ventricle. Indeed, only those voxels with higher
likelihood (> 0.5) are considered as part of the left ventricle
tissue.
Training
Half of the images and their corresponding myocardial
segmentations were manually cropped into 128 x 28 pixels
with a spatial resolution of 1.36 x 1.36 mm in the short-axis
around the heart. This ROI size was defined by an expert to
ensure that the entire left ventricle was included for all the
images. Then, the cropped images and their corresponding
myocardial segmentations were used to train the network with
the stochastic gradient descent (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
implementation of Keras [30]. In the proposed U-net we use
the Jaccard distance as objective function instead of the Dice’s
coefficient commonly used in image processing. The Jaccard
distance is defined as follows:
Jd(myopred, myotrue) = 1?
?
i myo
pred
i ? myotruei?
i myo
pred
i +
?
i myo
true
i ?
?
i myo
pred
i ? myotruei
,
where myopred and myotrue are the myocardial segmentation
prediction and the ground truth segmentation, and the
?
i myoi
refers to the pixel sum over the entire segmentation (prediction
or ground truth).
Annotated medical information like myocardial classifica-
tion is not easy to obtain due to the fact that one or more
experts are required to manually trace a reliable ground truth of
the myocardial classification. So, in this work it was necessary
to augment the original training dataset in order to increase
the examples. Also, data augmentation is essential to teach
the network the desired invariance and robustness properties.
Heterogeneity in the cardiac MRI dataset is needed to teach
the network some shift and rotation invariance, as well as
robustness to deformations. With this intention, during the
every training iteration, the input of the network was randomly
deformed by means of a spatial shift in a range of 10% of the
image size, a rotation in a range of 10? in the short axis, a
zoom in a range of 2x or by using a gaussian deformation field
(µ = 10 and ? = 20) and a B-spline interpolation. The data
augmentation has been performed on-the-fly to reduce the data
storage and achieve a total of 5500 new images by epoch.
III. RESULTS
Three sets of experiments are conducted to evaluate the
proposed methodology on the Sunnybrooks dataset [29]. In
the first two experiments, the papillary muscles (PM) were
excluded on both, the automatic and manual segmentation.
So, the proposed method will avoid to detect the PM as part
of the myocardial tissue.
In the first experiment, the proposed objective function loss,
batch normalization and residual learning were evaluated on
the classic U-net architecture with respect to the commonly
used Dice’s coefficient. Empirical results show that the Jaccard
distances (0.6± 0.1 mean accuracy Dice’s value) outperform
the Dice’s coefficient (0.58±0.1 mean accuracy Dice’s value)
when it is used as the objective loss function (Fig. 2a). More-
over, Fig. 2a shows that this improvement (Jaccard distance
vs. Dice’s coefficient) is uncorrelated with the use of batch
normalization and residual learning.
As results show on Fig. 2a and Table I, the use of the batch
normalization and residual learning strategies are of paramount
importance to achieve an accurate myocardial segmentation.

Furthermore, the combination of both strategies shows the
higher myocardial segmentation accuracy. However, if the
training accuracy with the strategies of batch normalization
and residual learning is analyzed, we can conclude that the
contribution of the batch normalization is higher than con-
tribution of the residual learning (Fig. 2b). Also, we can
conclude that the training accuracy of the residual learning
is comparable to the basic U-net for our architecture (i.e. 5
levels, 2 conv. operation by level and the same number of
features by level). Nonetheless, we strongly recommend to
use both strategies together due to the accuracy achieved by
them working together is remarkable higher than the individual
contribution of each one as it can be seen in Fig. 2b.

Finally, as it was expected, the third experiment revealed
that the accuracy tend to decrease when the PM were taking
into account as part of the myocardial tissue, since it makes the
myocardial tissue segmentation harder. However, the proposed
approach seems to be not affected and reaches a similar
accuracy to the previous experiment. We obtained 0.89 for
the Dice’s coefficient and a mean squared error of 0.01.

An example of the automatic 3D myocardial segmentation
can be seen in Fig. 4. In particular, Fig. 4a shows the
myocardial segmentation in three orthogonal views and Fig. 4b
shows the segmentation in two 3D views. Qualitative details
of the this Automatic 3D myocardial segmentation (Fig. 4) can
be seen in several slices in Fig. 5. They show that the proposed
myocardial segmentation provides a suitable approach for my-
ocardial segmentation in cardiac MRI. In yellow it is depicts
those voxels where the manual myocardial segmentation and
the proposed automatic segmentation overlaps, otherwise, the
voxels are depicted in magenta. As it can be seen only a
reduced number of voxels correspond to a non-overlapping
classification.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed an automatic 3D my-
ocardial segmentation approach for cardiac MRI by using
a deep learning network. Unlike previous approaches, our
method makes use of the Jaccard distance as objective loss
function, a batch normalization and residual learning strategies
to provide a suitable approach for myocardial segmentation.
Quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed
approach presents a high potential for being used to estimate
different structural and functional features for both prognosis
and treatment of different pathologies. Thanks to real time
data augmentation with free form deformations, it only need
very few annotated images (22 cardiac MRI) and has a very
reasonable training time of only 8.5 hours on a NVidia Tesla
C2070 (6 GB) for reaching a suitable accuracy of 0.9 Dice’s
coefficient and 0.0093 mean squared error in 30 epochs.
The segmentation and tracking of different cardiac struc-
tures, such as the left ventricle, have an important role in
the treatment of different pathologies. However, accurate and
reliable measurements for volumetric analysis and functional
assessment heavily rely on user interaction. The results ob-
tained in this work can be efficiently used for estimating
different structural (left ventricle mass, left ventricle volume
and ejection fraction among others) features. Additionally, this
work leads to extensions for automatic detection and tracking
of the right and left ventricle. Myocardial motion is useful in
the evaluation of regional cardiac functions such as the strain
and strain rate.
