Abstract
It is now a common practice to compare models of human language
processing by predicting participant reactions (such as reading times)
to corpora consisting of rich naturalistic linguistic materials. However,
many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text
and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic construc-
tions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. Here
we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain
many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding flu-
ent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with hand-corrected
parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data. Here we give
an overview of the content of the corpus and release the data.1
1 Introduction
It is becoming a standard practice to evaluate theories of human language
processing by their ability to predict psychometric dependent variables such
as per-word reaction time for standardized corpora of naturalistic text. De-
pendent variables that have been collected over fixed corpora include word
fixation time in eyetracking (Kennedy et al., 2003), word reaction time in

self-paced reading (Roark et al., 2009; Frank et al., 2013), BOLD signal in
fMRI data (Bachrach et al., ms), and event-related potentials (Dambacher
et al., 2006; Frank et al., 2015).
The more traditional approach to evaluating psycholinguistic models has
been to collect psychometric measures on hand-crafted experimental stimuli
designed to tease apart detailed model predictions. While this approach
makes it easy to compare models on their accuracy for specific constructions
and phenomena, it is hard to get a sense from experimental results of how
models compare on their coverage of a broad range of phenomena. When it
is standard practice to compare model predictions over standardized texts,
then it is easier to evaluate coverage.
Although the fixed corpus approach has these advantages, the existing
corpora currently used are based on naturally-occurring data, which is un-
likely to include the kinds of sentences which can crucially distinguish be-
tween theories. Many of the most puzzling phenomena in psycholinguistics,
and the phenomena which have been used to test models, have only been
observed in extremely rare constructions, such as multiply nested preverbal
relative clauses (Gibson and Thomas, 1999; Grodner and Gibson, 2005; Va-
sishth et al., 2010). Corpora of naturally-occurring text are unlikely to con-
tain these constructions. More generally, models of human language compre-
hension are more likely to make distinct predictions for sentences that cause
difficulty for humans, rather than for sentences that are easy to process. For
instance, models of comprehension difficulty based on memory integration
cost during parsing (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005; Schuler et al.,
2010; van Schijndel et al., 2013) will predict effects when the memory spans
required for parsing are large, but most syntactic dependencies in naturally-
occurring text are short (Temperley, 2007; Liu, 2008; Futrell et al., 2015).
In general, processing difficulty might be rare for naturally-occurring text,
because text written and edited in order to be easily understood.
Here we attempt to combine the strength of experimental approaches,
which can test theories using targeted low-frequency structures, and corpus
studies, which provide broad-coverage comparability between models. We
introduce and release a new corpus, the Natural Stories Corpus, a series
of English narrative texts designed to contain many low-frequency and psy-
cholinguistically interesting syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent
and coherent. The texts are annotated with hand-corrected Penn Treebank
style phrase structure parses, and Universal Dependencies parses automati-
cally generated from the phrase structure parses. We also release self-paced
2
reading time data for all texts, and word-aligned audio recordings of the
texts. We hope the corpus can form the basis for further annotation and
become a standard test set for psycholinguistic models.
2 Related Work
Here we survey datasets which are commonly used to test psycholinguistic
theories and how they relate to the current release.
Currently the most prominent psycholinguistic corpus for English is the
Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003), which contains 51,501 word tokens
in 2,368 sentences from British newspaper editorials, along with eyetracking
data from 10 participants. A dependency parse of the corpus is released in
Barrett et al.. Like in the current work, the eyetracking data in the Dundee
corpus is collected for sentences in context and so reflects influences beyond
the sentence level. The corpus has seen wide usage, see for example Demberg
and Keller (2008); Mitchell et al. (2010); Frank and Bod (2011); Fossum and
Levy (2012); Smith and Levy (2013); van Schijndel and Schuler (2015); Luong
et al. (2015).
The Potsdam Sentence Corpus (Kliegl et al., 2006) of German provides
1138 words in 144 sentences, with cloze probabilities and eyetracking data
for each word. Like the current corpus, the Potsdam Sentence Corpus was
designed to contain varied syntactic structures, rather than being gathered
from naturalistic text. The corpus consists of isolated sentences which do
not form a narrative, and during eyetracking data collection the sentences
were presented in a random order. The corpus has been used to evaluate
models of sentence processing based on dependency parsing (Boston et al.,
2008, 2011) and to study effects of predictability on event-related potentials
(Dambacher et al., 2006).
The MIT Corpus introduced in Bachrach et al. (ms) has similar aims
to the current work, collecting reading time and fMRI data over sentences
designed to contain varied structures. This dataset consists of four narratives
with a total of 2647 tokens; it has been used to evaluate models of incremental
prediction in Roark et al. (2009), Wu et al. (2010), and Luong et al. (2015).
The UCL Corpus (Frank et al., 2013) consists of 361 English sentences
drawn from amateur novels, chosen for their ability to be understood out
of context, with self-paced reading and eyetracking data. The goal of the
corpus is to provide a sample of typical narrative sentences, complementary

to our goal of providing a corpus with low-frequency constructions. Unlike
the current corpus, the UCL Corpus consists of isolated sentences, so the
psychometric data do not reflect effects beyond the sentence level.
Eyetracking corpora for other languages are also available, including the
Postdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus (Husain et al., 2014) and the
Beijing Sentence Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (Yan et al., 2010).
3 Corpus Description
3.1 Text
The Natural Stories corpus consists of 10 stories, comprising 10,245 lexical
word tokens and 485 sentences in total. The stories were developed by A.V.,
E.F., E.G. and S.P. by taking existing publicly available texts and editing
them to use many subject- and object-extracted relative clauses, clefts, top-
icalized structures, extraposed relative clauses, sentential subjects, senten-
tial complements, local structural ambiguity (especially NP/Z ambiguity),
idioms, and conjoined clauses with a variety of coherence relations. The
original texts are listed in Table 1.

If you were to journey to the North of England, you would come to a
valley that is surrounded by moors as high as mountains. It is in this
valley where you would find the city of Bradford, where once a thousand
spinning jennies that hummed and clattered spun wool into money for
the long-bearded mill owners. That all mill owners were generally busy
as beavers and quite pleased with themselves for being so successful
and well off was known to the residents of Bradford, and if you were to
go into the city to visit the stately City Hall, you would see there the
Crest of the City of Bradford, which those same mill owners created to
celebrate their achievements.

3.2 Parses
The texts were parsed automatically using the Stanford Parser (Klein and
Manning, 2003) and hand-corrected. Trace annotations were added by hand.
We provide the resulting Penn Treebank-style phrase structure parse trees.
We also provide Universal Dependencies parses (Nivre, 2015) automatically
converted from the corrected parse trees using the Stanford Parser.
3.3 Self-Paced Reading Data
We collected self-paced reading (SPR) data (Just et al., 1982) for the stories
from 181 native English speakers over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Text was
presented in a dashed moving window display; spaces were masked. Each
participant read 5 stories per HIT. 19 participants read all 10 stories, and
3 participants stopped after one story. Each story was accompanied by 6
comprehension questions. We discarded SPR data from a participant’s pass
through a story if the participant got less than 5 questions correct (89 passes
through stories excluded). We also excluded RTs less than 100 ms or greater
than 3000 ms. Figure 3 shows histograms of RTs per story.
3.3.1 Inter-Subject Correlations
In order to evaluate the reliability of the self-paced reading RTs and their
robustness across experimental participants, we analyzed inter-subject cor-

relations (ISCs). For each subject, we correlated the Spearman correlation
of that subject’s RTs on a story with average RTs from all other subjects on
that story. Thus for each story we get one ISC statistic per subject. Figure 4
shows histograms of these statistics per story.
3.3.2 Psycholinguistic Sanity Checks
In order to validate our RT data, we checked that basic psycholinguistic ef-
fects obtain in it. In particular, we examined whether the well-known effects
of frequency, word length, and surprisal (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008; Smith and
Levy, 2013) had an effect on RTs. To do this, for each of the three predic-
tors log frequency, log trigram probability, and word length, we fit a linear
mixed effects regression model with subject and story as random intercepts
(models with random slopes did not converge) predicting RT. Frequency and
trigram probabilities were computed from Google Books N-grams, summing
over years from 1990 to 2013. (These counts are also released with this
dataset.) The results of the regressions are shown in Table 3; we report
results from the maximal converging model. In keeping with well-known ef-

fects, increased frequency and probability both lead to faster reading times,
and word length leads to slower reading times.
3.4 Syntactic Constructions
Here we give an overview of the low-frequency or marked syntactic construc-
tions which occur in the stories. We coded sentences in the Natural Stories
corpus for presence of a number of marked constructions, and also coded 200
randomly selected sentences from the Dundee corpus for the same features.
The features coded are listed and explained in Appendix A. Figure 5 shows
the rates of these marked constructions per sentence in the two corpora.
From the figure, we see that the natural stories have especially high rates of
nonlocal VP conjunction, nonrestrictive SRCs, idioms, adjective conjunction,
noncanonical ORCs, local NP/S ambiguities, and it-clefts.
4 Conclusion
We have described a new psycholinguistic corpus of English, consisting of
edited naturalistic text designed to contain many rare or hard-to-process
constructions while still sounding fluent. We believe this corpus will provide
an important part of a suite of test sets for psycholinguistic models, exposing
their behavior in uncommon constructions in a way that fully naturalistic
corpora cannot. We also hope that the corpus as described here forms the
basis for further data collection and annotation.
