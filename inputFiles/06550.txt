Abstract—In this paper we present our exploratory findings
related to extracting knowledge and experiences from a com-
munity of senior tourists. By using tools of qualitative analysis
as well as review of literature, we managed to verify a set
of hypotheses related to the content created by senior tourists
when participating in on-line communities. We also produced
a codebook, representing various themes one may encounter
in such communities. This codebook, derived from our own
qualitative research, as well a literature review will serve as a
basis for further development of automated tools of knowledge
extraction. We also managed to find that older adults more
often than other poster in tourists forums, mention their age in
discussion, more often share their experiences and motivation to
travel, however they do not differ in relation to describing barri-
ers encountered while traveling. Keywords: netnography, social
media, older adults, on-line communities, qualitative research,

I. INTRODUCTION
According to almost all demographic projections, the com-
ing decades will see a global increase in the population of
older adults [31]. What is more, if current trends in societal
and technological development hold, this new population of
older adults will be healthier, more affluent and mobile than
any other older adults cohort in recorded history [34], thus
they will have more time, resources and abilities to participate
in tourism and traveling, both domestic and international, as
well as engage in on-line communities.
According to current research concerning the topic of older
adult tourism, and on-line community engagement, these two
types of activities provide many positive effects for the older
adult population. Tourism can improve overall wellbeing [23],
as well as the way older adults cope with health issues [7], [6],
while community engagement has many positive psychologi-
cal effects on older adults [35]. However, research shows that
older adults who wish to participate in life as tourists, experi-
ence many barriers and limitations related to their age, and the
face other factors both external and internal[16]. Research has
shown that addressing these barriers, such as the ones related
to safety (as a study by Balcerzak et al. suggest[1]), can be
achieved through listening to the experiences of older adults
and applying them in intelligent solutions
With modern developments in fields such as data mining
and natural language processing, a new promise opens for
addressing the needs of senior travelers directly, through
listening, and systematic extracting what they have to say,
when spontaneously engaging in activities within on-line travel
communities.
However before designing any forms of automated knowl-
edge extraction, one needs to explore what kind of themes and
topics are prevalent in the analyzed corpus of text. By doing so
one is able to recognize what specific parts of the texts should
be extracted, and what kind of ontology one needs to build,
in order to properly represent the structure of the data hidden
in a raw text. In this paper we wish to present the results of
such an exploratory task.
A. Research contribution & research question
We wish to focus on the design of the aforementioned
framework, and the information about senior tourists on-line
it helps to extract. The following detailed research questions
are addressed:
• What dimensions of social and individual activity are
present in on-line communities of older adult tourists.
• In what ways, based on the before mentioned di-
mensions, do senior tourists differ from other on-line
tourists communities?
These research questions can be translated into the following
hypotheses:
• Hypothesis I: Tourists aged 50+ mention their age more
often than members of other groups
• Hypothesis II: Tourists aged 50+ more often than mem-
bers of other groups speak about their limitations and
barriers
• Hypothesis III: Tourists aged 50+ more often than
members of other groups will recall their past experiences
of traveling.
• Hypothesis IV: Tourists aged 50+ connect their experi-
ences of limitations and barriers with their age.
The choice of these hypotheses is based on a set of pre-
sumption derived from the available literature. Works such as
done by [21] show that older adults who participate in an on-
line community often center their identity around their age.
Since this work was based mostly on research of bloggers, we
wanted to see if it extends to forum posters.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the Related
Work section, we present the review of studies of senior
tourism, older adult on-line communities, as algorithms used
in related tasks of content extraction. Next, the Analysis tools
section, describes in detail the dataset, and methodology used
by the researchers. The Results section presents obtained re-
sults, while the Conclusions and Further Work section presents
the ramifications of these results.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Older adults as tourists - constraints and limitations
Studies involving touristic activity among older adults can
be split into two main categories. First one, deals with
describing travel and touristic patterns among older adults,
often compared to other age groups. A study done by Collia
[5], in which travel patterns of older citizens of the US
were analyzed, would be a prime example. Other examples
include work by Nyaupane [29]. Such general overviews of
travel patterns by older adults were not limited to the US,
but were also attempted among other places in Poland by
Omelan [30] and China, by Gu [12]. Both studies focused
on differences within the older adults demographic, with
the study by Omelan finding differences based on place of
residence (rural vs Urban), and the study by Gu analyzing
through logistic regression the impact of well-being, gender
and social status on older adults travel patterns. Studies in
this category show also often a positive correlation between
various measures of psychological and physical well-being and
traveling, like in studies by Ferri [7] and Ferrer [6].
Another line of research in this category are studies concern-
ing the perception of traveling among older adults. A study
done by Gao [9], which focuses on travel perception among
older Chinese women, is a good example. Research was also
done with regard to emotional aspects of traveling, for example
a study by Mitas [23] focused on the role of positive emotion
and community building among senior tourists, while a study
by Zhang [39] described the constraints related to visiting
places connected to historical atrocities.
The other category of studies focuses more on researching
the constraints faced by older adults who partake in trav-
eling. The prime example of such research, which served
as an inspiration for the framework presented in this pa-
per, was work done by Kazeminia [16] where a dedi-
cated tool for content analysis called THE LEXIMANCER
http://info.leximancer.com/ was used on a corpus of posts
made by older adults on the Trip Advisor web page, to extract
a framework of constraints faced by older adults who travel.
Other exploratory work in this regard was done by Kim [17],
where three main types of constraints were identified, the
intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural ones. A similar
study done by Nimrod [26] revealed the most persistent
constraints through content analysis. However, this study was
criticized by authors like Mitas [23] for failing to focus on the
emotional aspects of the older adults traveling community.
The topic of travel constraint among older adults was
also approached by Bacs [2], and Fleisher [8] as well as,
Gudmundsson [13], Reed [33] and Page [32] who focused
more on health related issues.
B. Older adults and on-line communities
Substantial work in this topic was done by Nimrod who
not only managed to conduct quantitative analysis in order to
discover specific clusters within the older adult communities
(information swappers, aging-oriented, socializers) [27], ex-
tracted, through content analysis tools, topics mostly discussed
in senior on-line forums [25], but also, through on-line surveys
identified psychological benefits of participating in on-line
communities [28]. There were also studies, like the one by
Kowalik and Nielek which focused on communities of older
programmers [20].
Another thread of research was focused on barriers con-
cerning participation in on-line communities. Research like
the one done by Gibson [11] and Jaeger [15] states that issues
of privacy and accessibility form one of the biggest barriers.
Noteworthy is also research done by Lazar [21] who, by
analyzing blog posts of bloggers aged 50+, showed how people
within the community of older adults can address their own
identity and combat ageist stereotypes.
As participating in on-line communities is crucial for im-
proving well-being of older adults many researchers tried to
animate such activities [19], [18], [24].
C. Age, aging, ageism
Another factor important for the design of a framework
for understanding the experiences of senior tourists is the
perception of older adults’ age, by themselves, the older adults,
as well as from the perspective of others.
In the context of senior tourism, research, such as the one
done by Cleaver [4] shows that the perception of ones age
is in a mutual relation with ones particular motivations for
travelling. Work done by Ylanne [38], on the other hand,
represents the role of age perception among travel agencies
as an important factor.
D. Automated information extraction in the tourist domain
With the current availability of on-line tourist reviews,
research developed into the application of text mining and data
mining solutions that would make use of this data. Authors
have already mentioned the recent work by Gu [12] in which
travel tips would be extracted from travel reviews. Other recent
threads of research in this field are represented by Bhatnagar,
who also proposed a framework for extracting more subtle,
albeit more general and simpler aspects of travel experiences,
and a study concerning a methodology of mapping the data
related to medical tourism in South Korea done by [14].
III. STUDY DESIGN
A. Collected data
In order to design the framework and develop its applica-
tions, we decided to collect textual data from a single source
related, which is the ’Older traveler’ forum on the Lonely
Planet website.
In total, over 30 thousand posts from the last 15 years of
the forum’s existence were collected into a single database to
serve as a base for future testing and annotating jobs. When
compared to previous attempts at content analyzing tourism
among older adults such as works by [16], this dataset provides
a definitely larger scope of data to be collected and analyzed
due to its sheer size. However, since the paper presented
here focuses on preliminary work in preparing an annotation
protocol, only a fraction (100 posts) will be used for the
current coding and content analysis tasks. This fraction, like all
of the forum posts used in this study, were selected randomly
with a use of a simple random sampling.
The choice of this particular site and section of a site
dedicated only to older adults was based on methodological
considerations. Lonely Planet is one of the most popular
websites dedicated to tourism, based on a popular series of
guide books for tourists. Within the site one can find various
forums dedicated to specific locations, as well as specific
demographics groups of travelers, such as older adults, women
and members of the LGBTQ community.
Selecting the forum was based on established precedent
within the research of on-line communities, like the one done
by Nimrod [25], and Berdychevsky [3]. Using a dedicated
older adult forum, instead of all posts produced by older adults
within the forum, was a deliberate choice on the part of the
authors. Instead of using an arbitrary age for threshold of
defining someone as an older adult, used used self-labeling in
form of participation in the older adults forums as a defining
point for being treated as an older adult. The collected data
bears out this assumption, since all of the posts are written
on the behalf of the users, we did not observe a situation
when, a younger adult would write on a behalf of the older
adults. Since the main focus of this paper is to explore the
topic ontology for future extracting and knowledge mapping
of older adults as a community, it was important to collect
posts from a source were such community exists. Moreover,
by obtaining data from a single thematic forum, authors gained
an opportunity to include such aspects of community life as
emotional stances, as well as arguments used in discussion.
These two constitute an important element in the design of
the future framework, as well as differentiate the research
work presented here, from the established corpus of literature
where usually barriers, identity and emotions were researched
in isolation.
In order to address the research questions presented at the
beginning of this article, we decided to collect additional
sources from other Lonely Planet forums. In total 17 thousand
posts were extracted, out of which 100 were designated for the
coding task. This set serves as a baseline for comparing the
older adults against the general population of travelers. out of
this set a subset of 100 posts was drawn with the use of simple
random sampling.
In total 200 posts will be used for the analysis, such dataset
fits perfectly within the standard dataset size used in studies
related to the topic [22]. This number of posts also ensures
that the results of further statistical analysis will be valid as
statistical significance is concerned.
B. Literature review
In order to verify the dimensions of the framework, a
literature review was conducted in accordance to the guidelines
described by [22]. First, a v was conducted in order to acquire
the most persistent themes in regards to experiences of older
adults on-line in general, and senior travelers in general. The
thus extracted themes are presented in APPENDIX I.
C. Coding
The coding job was initiated with the objective of marking
the entire corpus. In order to conduct the task, dedicated
software called QDA MINER LITE (version 2.0.1). A group
of annotators was selected for the task and instructed in the
tagging protocol. Each post was read by two annotators who
were to mark whether or not the extracted themes appeared
in a given post. During the coding task the annotators would
discuss any discrepancies in their tagging. The conclusions
of this discussion were later applied to the code book. After
the coding job was finished and all discrepancies would be
addressed, tagging annotation agreement was calculated with
the use of Cohen’s Kappa, the value achieved (83%) indicated
a high level of inter-rater agreement.
IV. RESULTS
Due to the nature of the tagged corpora, we decided to use
two statistical measures for testing the validity of the claimed
hypotheses. First measure, the T-student’s test was used for
testing the significance of the observed differences between
seniors and general population. Therefore, the hypotheses I to
III can be translated to a set of statistical hypotheses about
the average difference between posts from two independent
samples. For the sake of further testing, the significance level
for all of the tests has been set to 0,05. However, due to
the fact that multiple pairs of values are compared at once, a
correction was applied to the significance threshold, based on
the Bonferroni correction. The adjusted significance threshold
was therefore set to 0,007. Hypothesis IV, on the other hand,
will be addressed with the use of Cohen’s kappa as a measure
of agreement between two dimensions in a single post.
The frequency of the dimensions present in the tagged posts,
is shown in table III-C. The values given in the table present
how often within all of the posts from a specific group did a
given dimension occur. Since more than one dimension could
occur in a single post, the percentages do not add up to 100%.
Even without conducting the statistical tests, one can notice
some general trends visible in the data. First, the references
to location and personal experiences are the most frequent
aspects of the framework, visible in all three groups. There is
also a stark contrast between the references of external and
internal hindrances. While limitations, for the most part, are
mentioned quite often, the barriers are scant, especially outside
of the senior tourist group.
Intergroup comparison provides further insight into the
differences between the designed dimension. By comparing
the occurrences of the age reference and ageism between the
senior tourists and the general population, one can clearly see
that age references within the Lonely Planet forums are almost
exclusively related with the senior tourist community, which
confirms the validity of Hypothesis I. It has to be pointed
out, however, that experiences of ageism are reported rare
(only 6% of the posts). This may mean that explicit forms of
ageism are not the main facet of the older adult identity, unlike
more subtle implicit forms such as internalized ageism which
may be expressed by age references in a specific context. This

Age
Reference
All instances of referring to age either of
oneself or of somebody else. Age used as
an argument in discussion or mentioned as
a part of a narrative. Includes both literal
and figurative mentions of age.
• As a 70 year old... For people my age • In your age it is
important • A senior has different needs • I am getting to old
for this
Location ref-
erence
All instances of referring to a specific lo-
cation, which the user has visited, wants
to visits, considers visiting, asks for ad-
vice about. Locations include whole conti-
nents, countries, cities, provinces, villages
or particular locations like tourist attrac-
tions, churches, building, land marks etc.
• Has anyone been to Romania? • Visit Singapore, it’s awesome.
• I am off to Cambodia • I was In China in the seventies
Limitations This dimension refers to instances of ex-
ternal factors which, in the perception of
the poster hinder the individuals ability to
travel, or may provide difficulties while
traveling to a specific location. Includes
both reports of such factors, complaints
about such limitations, as well as advice and
asking for advice on the topic of external
limitations. External factors, are related to
traits typical to the environment, rather than
the individual.
• ATMs don’t work in Somalia, it’s a pain in the ass • I couldn’t
go to Vietnam, because my visa expired • I can’t stay abroad,
because I can lose my country’s pension • I didn’t feel good
in a country which treats women badly • Use a visa card, and
exchange your dollars to a local currency, it is better that way
• Ulaanbatar has only one working ATM • The local police is
corrupt, they wouldn’t help me unless I bribed them • Any advice
on dealing with altitude sickness in Peru?
Ageism Refers to any instance using ageist stereo-
types in discussion, or a description of
ageist experiences held by the user.
• You old people are all the same with your fear • When I was
standing in line for the cruise, some young fellow told me that in
my age, I am not fit for ocean cruises to Antarctica
Barriers This dimension refers to instances of inter-
nal factors which, in the perception of the
pster, hinder the individuals ability to travel,
or may provide difficulties while traveling
to a specific location. Includes both reports
of such factors, complaints about such lim-
itations, as well as advice and asking for
advice on the topic of internal barriers.
These are typical to the individual.
• I would love to travel, but my husband doesn’t allow it • The
fact that I have to work limits my travel plans • This year I
skipped South Asia, because my mother died • I wish I could go
backpack, but with my sick knees it became impossible • I was
afraid of malaria in India
Experiences Refers to experiences of traveling, recount-
ing of encounters made during ones travels,
regardless of location and time perspective.
This includes particular experiences, as well
as general observations taken from the sin-
gle experiences.
• When we entered the market, I saw elephants and arabian
spices on display • The cruise was amazing! • The hostels I’ve
been to always were full of interesting people of all ages
Motivation Refers to experiences of traveling, recount-
ing of encounters made during ones travels,
regardless of location and time perspective.
This includes particular experiences, as well
as general observations taken from the sin-
gle experiences.
• I would love to visit India, because I want to spiritually awake
• Cambodia is great if you want escape from the fast paced life
of western cities • This is why I travel, this gives me a sense of
being alive • I really love to travel solo, it lets me fully enjoy
my experiences
confirms the findings on the language of ageism made by [10],
and provide an additional topic for developing algorithms for
text mining.
The relation between age, limitations and barriers expressed
in Hypothesis II, when analyzed with the given data also
provides interesting results. Although there is no significant
difference between senior tourists and general population
groups when it comes to mentioning limitations, the difference
between mentioning barriers is visible and significant, even
tough it is a very scarcely appearing dimension. This lends
credence to the notion that older adults who are tourists may
experience a varying set of problems when engaging in their
travels. However, in view of these results, the hypothesis was
validated only partly within the dimension of internal factors
such as health and personal issues. This lines with results
obtained by other researchers [16].
Hypothesis IV stated that older adult tourists, when dis-
cussing their limitation and barriers, associate them with their
age. In order to validate this hypothesis, authors decided to
calculate the Cohen’s kappa agreement index between the age
reference and limitations and barriers dimensions within the
senior tourist group. The obtained result of Cohen’s Kappa
was 0 in both cases, which indicates that the relation between
the given dimension is no different from the one that would
arise from pure chance. The ramifications of this observation
are crucial. It shows that there is no direct, explicit relation
between the perception of age and factors that hinder the older
adults plans for travel. Therefore, Hypothesis IV has to be
deemed as falsified. However, this finding corroborates the
observations presented when analyzing Hypothesis II.

Hypothesis III focused on recalling the traveling experiences
of older adults. As shown in table II, it is clear that tourists
from the senior tourist group are significantly more likely
to recall their travel experiences when engaging within their
on-line community. This leads to the conclusion that third
hypothesis is validated.
V. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK
By conducting the literature review and a coding task,
supplemented by a the analysis of codes, authors planned
to better understand what aspects of the dynamics of senior
tourist on-line communities are persistent and demand more
focus when designing a framework for the automated mapping
and extraction of knowledge from unstructured text created by
an on-line community. The analysis of data leads the authors
to accept non trivial conclusions in regards to the nature of
on-line communities of older adult tourists.
First of all, the role of age or the perception of ones
age exists in a complex relation with other aspects of the
community. Even though the perception of age is an important
part of the community of older adult tourists, it is not, at
least when explicitly stated, related to the problems they face
while traveling. What is more, there is no difference between
mentions of external limitations between older adults and
general users of the travel forum, which means that older
adults face problems at similar rates to other groups.
What sets them aside, however, is their tendency to report
problems related to health and personal issues. Moreover, older
adults are more likely to share their experiences to the travels
they made.
These findings have significant ramifications for the knowl-
edge extraction projects as proposed in the Introduction to this
article. The fact that older adults do not verbally associate their
problems with their age, indicated that the machine learning
algorithms would have to be focused not only on detecting
the dimensions of limitations experienced by older adults, but
also should be able to extract implicit relations between them
and the age of tourists.
The importance of storytelling and motivation for older
adults also provides an additional level of challenge for the
framework. Here the use of such algorithms like recursive
neural networks is suggested by the authors to properly extract
the sequence of events described by the poster, while the
motivation aspect can be connected to the limitations and age
dimensions, so that a more comprehensive picture of older
adults experiences can be extracted.
What is more, the task of extracting knowledge not explic-
itly stated by the members of the on-line community would
constitute an interesting topic in the field of natural language
processing.
The full corpus of texts from the traveling forums will be
tagged by a group of trained taggers and later will be used for
training a set of machine learning algorithms in order to au-
tomatically detect the designed dimensions of the framework,
as well as mapping the relations between them. The database
thus created would connect specific locations with the specific
problems and experiences typical to the members of the 50+
demographic category. In the final stage the framework would
be embedded in a web application that would allow us to
extract structured implicit knowledge that can be learned from
the communities of older adult tourists. Such algorithms can
also be combined with knowledge on developer team work in
order to further improve its quality[36],[37].
