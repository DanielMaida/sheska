ABSTRACT
Biomonitoring of waterbodies is vital as the number of anth-
ropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems keeps growing.
However, the continuous decrease in funding makes it im-
possible to meet monitoring goals or sustain traditional ma-
nual sample processing. In this paper, we review what kind
of statistical tools can be used to enhance the cost efficiency
of biomonitoring: We explore automated identification of
freshwater macroinvertebrates which are used as one indica-
tor group in biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems. We pre-
sent the first classification results of a new imaging system
producing multiple images per specimen. Moreover, these
results are compared with the results of human experts. On a
data set of 29 taxonomical groups, automated classification
produces a higher average accuracy than human experts.
1. INTRODUCTION
Benthic macroinvertebrates are a diverse group of species
that quickly react to changes in their environment (Rosen-
berg and Resh, 1993). Their community composition can
reflect even subtle human-induced changes in their environ-
ment, making them an ideal indicator group for aquatic bio-
monitoring (Wright et al., 1984; Karr and Chu, 2000). In
many countries, biomonitoring of benthic macroinvertebra-
tes is a key part of ecological status assessment of surface
waters required by the European Union’s Water Framework
Directive (WFD, 2000).
The traditional process of macroinvertebrate biomoni-
toring is presented in Fig. 1. First, macroinvertebrates are
sampled, usually by using a kick-net method (e.g. Brua et al.,
2011). Second, the specimen are sorted out from the detritus
and identified manually by an expert. Third, the observed
taxa abundancies are used to calculate several biological in-
dices indicating changes compared to previous sampling or
a reference community. Finally, the index values are combi-
ned to evaluate the ecological status of the sampled water-
body.

In macroinvertebrate biomonitoring a large proportion
of the total cost and time is spent on manual identification
by highly trained experts. It takes several years to train an
expert and manually identifying a sample of few thousand
individuals can take hours. The monitoring process could be
expedited substantially by shifting from manual to automa-
ted identification and in recent years there have been ma-
ny studies on the automated identification of benthic mac-
roinvertebrates (Tirronen et al., 2009; Lytle et al., 2010; Ki-
ranyaz et al., 2010a,b; A?rje et al., 2010; Kiranyaz et al.,
2011; Joutsijoki and Juhola, 2012; Joutsijoki et al., 2014;
A?rje et al., 2013, 2017). Many biologists tend to oppose the
shift to automated identification of macroinvertebrates due
to fear of it not being accurate enough. However, manual
identification has been found to be surprisingly error pro-
ne as well (Haase et al., 2010). While there exist studies on
the automated classification of macroinvertebrates, to our
knowledge, none of them include a comparison between
manual and automated identification accuracy.
In this article we gather classification results achieved in
previous studies on automated identification of macroinver-
tebrates on single image data. We introduce a new imaging

system producing multiple images per specimen and present
classification results on the new multiple image data base.
We also compare the accuracy of automated classification
to that of human experts.
2. AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION
There has been increasing interest in automated classifica-
tion of benthic macroinvertebrates as continuing budget cuts
disable the use of manual identification. The classification
task is a complex one due to the large number of taxono-
mic groups and the amount of features needed to differen-
tiate the taxa. In order to use automated classification met-
hods, the specimens need to be imaged onto a computer
and the classification methods need to be trained with da-
ta first keyed traditionally by several taxonomic experts. In
our analyses, we have used both single image data and mul-
tiple image data.
2.1. Single image data
In the first phase of the study, the specimens were scanned
onto a computer in single taxon batches using VueScan(c)
software (http://www.hamrick.com/, Phoenix, Arizona, USA)
with an HP Scanjet4850 flatbed scanner at an optical reso-
lution of 2400 d.p.i. The scanned images were normalized
to the same intensity range and color balance by using a ca-
libration target. Individual specimens were segmented from
the batch image, and each specimen was saved as a single
posture image (for examples, see Figure 2). A set of simple
geometry and intensity-based features were extracted for
each specimen from the single posture images using Ima-
geJ (Rasband, 2010).
In a pilot study, A?rje et al. (2010) studied automated
identification of river macroinvertebrates on a data set of
8 different taxonomical groups and 1350 individual speci-
mens. Although the taxa included in this data set are repre-
sentative of taxa commonly found in rivers they form but a
small subset of the 30–75 taxa typically encountered at indi-
vidual sites. A larger data set of 35 taxonomical groups and
6418 specimens was used in A?rje et al. (2013). In the pilot
study, we extracted 15 features from gray scale images and
with the larger data, 64 features from gray scale and RGB
images.
There exists a vast amount of different algorithms and
models for classification. In the pilot study, A?rje et al. (2010)
used tree-based methods (C4.5, Quinlan (1993) and RF, Brei-
man (2001)) and Bayesian classifiers (QDA, Hastie et al.
(2009) and RBA, A?rje et al. (2013)) and apart from the C4.5,
achieved a promising classification accuracy of 92 %. With
the larger data set, A?rje et al. (2013) included more Baye-
sian classifiers (NB, LDA, Hastie et al., 2009), support vec-
tor machines (SVM, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), k-nearest

neighbors (KNN, Hastie et al., 2009), neural networks (MLP,
Ripley, 1996) and a radial basis function network (RBFN,
Buhmann, 2003). The results are shown in Table 1. With
the larger and more challenging data, the highest achieved
accuracy was 81.2 %.
In another work, A?rje et al. (2017) used the larger image
data with few modifications: With one taxon excluded from
the study and four taxa combined into two, the data compri-
sed of 32 taxonomic classes. In addition to the previously
mentioned classifiers, a kernel extension of Extreme Lear-
ning Machine (GEKELM, Iosifidis et al., 2015) was emplo-
yed and it achieved the highest classification accuracy of
84.1 %.
2.2. Multiple image data
In the second phase of the study, a new imaging system was
built to enable multiple images per specimen. The system is
Fig. 3. Schematic of the imaging system for macroinver-
tebrates pictured from above.
described in Figure 3. It consists of two Basler ACA1920-
155UC cameras (frame rate of 150 fps) with Megapixel Mac-
ro Lens (f=75mm, F:3.5-CWD<535mm) and a high power
LED light. The cameras are placed at a 90 degree angle to
each other to ensure multiple postures of each specimen.
The software builds a model of the background and sets off
the cameras when a significant change in the view of the ca-
mera is detected. A specimen is dropped into a cuvette filled
with alcohol. As it sinks, both cameras take multiple shots
of it and the resulting images are stored onto a computer
(See example images in Figure 4). The number of images
per specimen depends on the size and weight of each speci-
men: Heavier specimen sink to the bottom of the cuvette
faster, leading to a smaller number of images.
Using the described imaging device, the Finnish Envi-
ronment Institute compiled an image data base of 126 lotic
freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa and over 2.6 million ima-
ges. For the current work, we restricted the number of clas-
ses to 29 taxa present at a human proficiency test to compa-
re the classification results with human experts. We also re-
stricted the number of images per specimen to a maximum
of 50 images for computational reasons. If a specimen had
more images from both cameras combined, we randomly
selected 50 of them. The final data comprises of 7742 ob-
servations and a total of 367341 images. Using ImageJ, the
same set of 64 features was extracted from the images as for
the phase one data.
With the 64 features, extracted from the multiple image
data, we explored automated classification using MLP, RF
and SVM. We split the observations randomly into training
(70 %), validation (10 %) and test (20 %) data 10 times.
Fig. 4. Example images of a Polycentropus flavomaculatus
specimen from two cameras. The top row images are from
camera 1 and the bottom row images from camera 2.
With each data split, we used the training data to build the
model and the validation data to select optimal parameter
values. Once the parameters were fixed, the training and va-
lidation data were combined to train the model again. Each
image of the test data was classified and the final class for
each observation was based on majority vote among all the
images of the specimen. All the models were built using R
(R Core Team, 2016). The SVM model (Chang and Lin,
2011) was built using a Gaussian kernel and with a grid
search for the parameters over c = {28, 29, . . . , 212} and
? = {2?11, 2?10, . . . , 2?9}. The RF (Breiman et al., 2007)
was built using ntree = 1000. For MLP (Hornik et al.,
2009), the number of hidden units was optimized with a grid
search over h1 = {45, 50, 55, 60, 65} for the first layer and
h2 = {0, 20, 40} for the second layer. The results are shown
in Table 2.
The highest classification accuracy is achieved with SVM.
Protonemura sp., Hydropsyche saxonica, Diura sp. and Cap-
nopsis schilleri have high error rates due to a low number of
observations in the training data. The hardest taxa to identi-
fy with adequate amount of training data are Baetis vernus
group which is usually confused with Baetis rhodani, and
Kageronia fuscogrisea and Polycentropus irroratus that are
confused with several other taxa.
The classification results presented in Table 2 were ob-
tained with very simple geometric and intensity-based fea-
tures and higher classification accuracy could be obtained
using more refined features. In fact, even a simple principal
component transformation that makes the features uncorre-
lated already slightly improves the classification accuracy

for SVM (acc = 87.4%, sd(acc) = 0.005) and MLP (acc =
79.7%, sd(acc) = 0.011). With a convolutional neural network
(CNN, Krizhevsky et al., 2012) that uses the original ima-
ges as input instead of features, the classification accuracy
is even higher. We applied the MatConvNet (Vedaldi and
Lenc, 2015) implementation of the Alexnet model with batch
size 256 and 60 training epochs in Matlab (MATLAB, 2010)
and achieved an average classification accuracy of 93.4 %
(sd(acc) = 0.006).
Fig. 5. Classification accuracy of SVM plotted against the
maximum number of images per specimen.
We also studied, how the maximum number of ima-
ges per observation affects the classification accuracy. We
explored this with nimg = {1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 50, 100} and used
SVM for classification. The results are presented in Figure
5. From Figure 5, it is clear that classification accuracy inc-
reases with the number of images per specimen. However,
the difference in accuracy between a maximum of 30, 50
or 100 images is quite small while the difference in compu-
tational costs is much greater. It is crucial to consider both
when deciding on the number of images to use per speci-
men. The classification accuracy achieved for the multiple
image data presented here is not directly comparable with
the results for the larger single image data of Section 2.1 as
the data sets have only 14 taxa in common. However, from
Figure 5 it is evident that having more than one image per
specimen clearly improves the classification accuracy.
3. MANUAL CLASSIFICATION
In order to compare automated and manual classification,
we need classification results on the same set of taxa for
both. The Finnish Environment institute organized a pro-
ficiency test on taxonomic identification of boreal freshwa-
ter lotic, lentic, profundal and North-Eastern Baltic benthic
macroinvertebrates in March 2016. The aim of the test was
to assess the reliability of professional and semi-professional
identification of macroinvertebrate taxa routinely encounte-
red during North-Eastern Baltic coastal or boreal lake and
river monitoring (Meissner et al., 2017). A part of the pro-
ficiency test included 10 experts each identifying 50 speci-
mens of lotic freshwater macroinvertebrates belonging to
a total of 46 taxonomic groups, of which 29 are in com-
mon with the multiple image data introduced in Section
2.2. The average accuracy for the 46 taxa data was 93.2 %
(sd = 0.061) and for the 29 taxa in common with the image
data, the average accuracy was 92.7 % (sd = 0.064). The
hardest taxon to be identified was Hydropsyche saxonica as
half of the specimen were confused with Hydropsyche an-
gustipennis.
4. DISCUSSION
The mismatch between funding and biomonitoring goals
calls for more efficient monitoring processes. One way to
lower the cost of macroinvertebrate biomonitoring is to shift
from manual to automated identification of samples. The
material costs of the imaging system described in Section
2.2 are approximately 4-5K e, while the price of a high
quality stereo microscope traditionally used for macroin-
vertebrate identification is twice as much. The imaging sys-
tem is more affordable and it fits well into the work flow
of sample processing. Whether using manual or automa-
ted identification, the sampled specimens need to be sorted
from the detritus. As a natural extension of this, the operator
can drop a specimen into the cuvette of the imaging system
before placing it into a vial for storing.
Automated classification can enhance the cost-effeciency
of the macroinvertebrate sample processing also due to its
speed. Training a human expert takes years while – depen-
ding on the choice of a classifier and the size of the training
data – training a classification model can take 1–5 hours.
Predicting taxonomic groups for a sample of 1600 speci-
mens only takes a few minutes of computing compared to
the 1–12 hours of manual labor. Also, once a classifier is
trained, using it does not require expertise.
Of course, the viability of shifting to automated classi-
fication depends on the classification accuracy above all. In
this paper, we presented classification results on an image
data comprising 29 taxa also present at a human expert pro-
ficiency test. The achieved classification accuracy (87.4 %
for SVM and 93.4 % for CNN) is in the range of human
accuracy of the proficiency test (82.4? 100%) with the sa-
me taxa. The proficiency test included one or two speci-
men per taxon for each participant while the image test data
for automated classification comprised a total 1557 obser-
vations. When using the exact same amount of observations
per taxon for testing as in the proficiency test, the classifica-
tion accuracy for automated classifiers decreases but this is
due to the fact that the image data is not a balanced data
set and some of the 29 taxa have very few observations for
training.
In order to adopt the automated identification process
in practice, we need to achieve similarly high classifica-
tion accuracy with a larger number of taxonomic groups. In
this paper, we restricted the taxa to 29 in order to provide a
comparison to human experts. Typically, 30–75 macroinver-
tebrate taxa are encountered at individual sites. While there
is need for extending the classifiers to more taxa, the results
so far are very promising.
