Abstract. Text segmentation in a video is drawing attention of researchers in 
the field of image processing, pattern recognition and document image analysis 
because it helps in annotating and labeling video events accurately. We propose 
a novel idea of generating an enhanced frame from the R, G, and B channels of 
an input frame by grouping high and low values using Min-Max clustering 
criteria. We also perform sliding window on enhanced frame to group high and 
low values from the neighboring pixel values to further enhance the frame. 
Subsequently, we use k-means with k=2 clustering algorithm to separate text 
and non-text regions. The fully connected components will be identified in the 
skeleton of the frame obtained by k-means clustering. Concept of connected 
component analysis based on gradient feature has been adapted for the purpose 
of symmetry verification. The components which satisfy symmetric verification 
are selected to be the representatives of text regions and they are permitted to 
grow to cover their respective region fully containing text. The method is tested 
on variety of video frames to evaluate the performance of the method in terms 
of recall, precision and f-measure. The results show that method is promising 
and encouraging.

1   Introduction 
The retrieval of text information from images and videos is a very hot research area 
and it has gained increasing attention in the recent years. Text in images and video 
sequences can provide very useful semantic information which would be a good key 
to describe the image content and help a machine to understand it. This would help in 
bridging the gap between the low level and high level features [1-3]. Therefore, text 
segmentation and localization in video plays a vital role in several applications such 
as indexing video retrieval, video event identification, video understanding and video 
tracking etc. However, text segmentation is still a challenging problem because of the 
low resolution, complex background, unconstrained colors, sizes, and alignments of 
the characters [4-5].  
The methods [5-7] in document analysis cannot be used directly for video text 
segmentation as these methods require complete shape of the character components 
and high resolution images with plain background. These constraints may not be true 
for video as video usually have low resolution and complex background images.  
Therefore, the document analysis methods are not suitable.  It is also observed from 
the literature on text detection from natural scene images that the methods [8-10] one 
or other ways extract features based on shape of the characters. Though these methods 
work for complex background images but they require high resolution images. 
Therefore, the scene text detection from natural scene methods cannot be applied on 
directly on video images.  
In general, the existing methods on video text detection can be classified as 
connected component based [11-12], texture based [13-15] and edge and gradient 
based [16-19] methods. The connected component based methods are same as 
documents analysis methods. Therefore, they work only for high resolution and 
simple background images. Texture based methods work well for complex 
background images but they require expensive classifier to classify text and non-text 
components. In addition, these methods are sensitive to font, font size and multi-
script. To overcome the problems of the above categories, the edge and gradient based 
methods are proposed. These methods are fast compared to the above two categories. 
Recently, Eigen based method [20] is proposed to detect text in video where the 
method explores Eigen value analysis to classify text and non-text pixels for the both 
low and high resolution images. Since the method involves Eigen value analysis and 
gradient information, it is said to be expensive and give low precision for complex 
background images. In the same way, the method [21] based on run-lengths between 
inter and intra text component is proposed for video text detection. This method said 
to be simple and effective for both low resolution and high resolution video images. 
However, the methods produce more false positives due to text like edges in the 
background and hence the methods report high false positive rate and low precision. It 
is noted from the literature review that none of the existing methods give perfect 
solution to video text segmentation. In addition, none of the methods explore the 
combination of color values for text enhancement and symmetry based on stroke 
width for finding text representatives.  
Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel method to explore the color values and 
symmetry concepts to accurate video text segmentation. The main contribution of the 
paper is that sharpening text information and widening gap between text and non-text 
using color values mapping and proposing new symmetry to identify the text 
representatives, which eliminates almost all background information since the 
symmetry is derived based on characteristics of text components. With the help of 
Sobel edge of the enhanced text image, we propose region growing to segment the 
complete using text representatives. In this way, the proposed method is different 
from the literature and is effective for video text segmentation.   
2. Proposed Methodology 
We observe that the color values of text pixel in R, G and B sub-bands usually are 
high values compared to its background values because the fact that text pixel have 
high contrast value compared to non-text pixel. To extract such observation, we 
propose Max-Min clustering on three values in R, G and B for each pixel to identify 
high contrast value to replace the pixel value in the image. As a result, we get high 
values for text pixels and low values for non-text pixels which is called enhanced 
image. Further to increase the gap between text and non-text pixels, we again propose 
Max-Min cluster with same criteria to identify the high contrast values from the 
neighbors. This results in sharpen image where text pixel are brighter than the pixel in 
the enhanced image. Since sharpened image increases the gap between the text and 
non-text pixels, we apply k-means with k=2 to obtain text cluster. To analyze the 
components in the text cluster, the method obtains skeleton image and the skeletons 
are checked whether they are fully connected components or not. We believe that at 
least one of the text components in skeleton image satisfies the fully connected 
component condition. This operation eliminates most of the background information 
as they do not satisfy the fully connected component criteria. We call them as text 
candidates. Due to complex background, there are chances that non-text components 
are considered as text candidates. Therefore, we propose novel symmetry criterion 
which is computed based stroke width of the text components. The stroke width is 
estimated by analyzing the gradient direction of each pixel of text components. The 
output of this operation is called as text representative image. For each text 
representative, the method applies region growing to grow the contour of the text 
representative along text direction in Sobel edge image of the enhanced image to 
segment the complete text. The flow diagram can be seen in Figure 1 where it shows 
all the steps of the proposed method.

2.1 Grouping Color Values for Text Enhancement 
For the color input image shown in Figure 2(a), the method obtains three color sub-
band images that are R-image, G-image and B-image shown respectively in Figure 
2(b)-(d). In order to identify the high intensity value in three sub-bands, we propose 
Max-Min clustering criteria which select Maximum (Max) and Minimum (Min) value 
from R, G, B sub-bands for each pixel. Then the third value is compared with Max 
and Min values to find its closest value. If the third value is close to Max value then it 
forms a Max cluster with Max value. The method selects maximum value in the Max 
cluster to replace actual pixel value. Similarly, the actual pixel will be replaced by the 
minimum value if the third value is close to Min value and it forms a Min cluster. In 
this way, the Max-Min cluster does grouping to identify the high intensity values for 
each pixel in the input image which results in enhanced image as shown in Figure 2(e) 
where one can see the text pixels are brightened compare to the pixels in three sub-
bands and input image. The basis for this is that usually text pixel has high intensity 
value in any one of three sub-bands compared to its background.

2.2 Grouping Neighbor Values for Sharpening Text  
It is true that text pixel must have high value compared to its neighbors because of 
high contrast of text pixels. To increase the gap between text and non-text pixels, we 
propose sliding window operation where we use the above process to sharpen the text 
pixel and to suppress the non-text pixel based on neighbor information. As a result, 
we get sharpened image as shown in Figure 2(f) where the text pixel are still brighter 
than the pixel in the enhanced image shown in Figure 2(e).

2.3   Text Candidates 
The above two methods presented in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 help in widening gap 
between text and non-text pixels. This clue inspired us to use k-means clustering 
algorithm with k = 2 on sharpened image shown in Figure 2(f) to separate the text 
cluster. Since k-means clustering is unsupervised method, we consider cluster that 
gives high mean value compared to other mean of cluster as a text cluster. It is valid 
because high values will be classified into one cluster and that must be text cluster. 
The output of k-means can be seen in Figure 3(a) where almost all text pixel are 
classified as text including few high contrast non-text pixel.  
                                                                             
As it is noted that text cluster given by k-means provides binary information of both 
text and non-text components as shown in Figure 3(a). To reduce the pixel width to 
single pixel and preserve the shape of the text component, we get skeleton of the 
(a)  K-means output                    (b)  Skeleton image          (c) Fully connected components 
 
Figure 3. Steps to obtain text candidates 
components using skeleton method as shown in Figure 3(b) where due to low 
resolution and complex background, skeleton may not preserve the shape of the 
components but it gives significant information to study the characteristics of text and 
non-text. For the purpose of removing non-text components from the skeleton image, 
we test whether text components satisfies fully connected component condition or not 
because it is fact that text components must be connected without any disjoint 
compared to non-text components where most of them are disjoint. The output of 
performing fully connected component testing is shown in Figure 3(c) where one can 
see most of the non-text components are removed and we call this output as text 
candidate image. The fully connected component is defined as starting and ending of 
the contour of the component should meet at one point. However, still we can see 
some non-text components in the results shown in Figure 3(c). We propose novel 
feature for text component verification in the following section.  
                                           
2.4 Symmetry Criteria for Text Representative  
 
We are inspired by the work presented in [10] where the stroke width concept is used 
for text detection and text component separation successfully. It works based on the 
fact that the stroke width is constant throughout the character while for non-text the 
stroke width distance is arbitrary. For each pixel in the fully connected component, 
the method computes stroke width distance that is traversing in perpendicular 
direction to the gradient direction of the pixel till it reaches white pixel which we call 
reached pixels. In this way, the stroke width is computed for each pixel in the fully 
connected component. Then to find dominant stroke width distance, we plot as 
histogram for the stroke width distances to choose the stroke width distance which 
gives highest peak as a dominant stroke width distance. Due to low resolution and 
complex background, it is hard to get complete shape of the characters. Therefore, 
one cannot expect constant stroke width for the character and hence we choose 
dominant stroke width distance for verification. For each reached pixel of the 
component, we obtain dominant stroke width distance.  Then the method compares 
those two dominant stroke width distances to test the symmetry criteria. If both the 
distances are same then it is considered as the text component as it satisfies the 
symmetry criteria. This is true because according to stroke width concept presented in 
[10], the stroke width distance of the starting pixel and the reached pixel should be 
same. Note that the gradient image is obtained by performing the vertical and 
horizontal mask operation on the enhanced image as shown in Figure 4(a) and Figure 
4(b) and the combined gradient image is shown in Figure 4(c) to estimate stroke 
width distance for the pixels in the fully connected components. The result of 
symmetry verification is shown in Figure 4(d) where almost all non-text components 
are removed and these components are called as text representatives.  
    
 
 
2.5 Region Growing For Text Segmentation  
The text representatives obtained by the previous section are considered as seed 
points to segment full text in the image. Therefore, we propose region growing 
method using Sobel edge map of the enhanced image as shown in Figure 4(e) for the 
purpose of text segmentation. We believe that the symmetry verification gives at least 
one seed point for one text line. The contour of the seed point grows pixel by pixel till 
it reaches white pixel of the neighbor component along text direction in Sobel edge 
map of the enhanced image. This process continues till end of the text line. The end of 
the text line is determined based on experimental study on space between the words 
and characters. The region growing works based on the assumption that the space 
between text lines is greater than the space between the words and characters. The 
main advantage of the region growing is that it segments text line of any orientation 
because it works based on nearest neighbor concept. For example, nearest neighbor 
for first character in the text line would be second character and for second character, 
third character is the nearest neighbor. Therefore, generally the region growing 
segment text individual text lines but sometimes due to noisy pixel between the text 
lines and disconnections, the method combines two to three adjacent text lines as 
shown in Figure 4(f) where the method segment four text line as one segment. This is 
the main drawback of this method. As a result, there is a scope for improving the 
region growing method so that it segments text lines properly.

3. Experimental Results 
 
The proposed method is tested on variety of video frames to evaluate the performance 
of the method in terms of recall, precision and f-measure. Here we consider dataset 
provided by National University of Singapore (NUS) which contains video frames, 
extracted from news programmers, sports videos and movie clips. In this dataset, 
there are both graphic text and scene text of different languages, e.g. English, Chinese 
and Korean [20]. We consider 50 video text images to determine the recall, precision 
and f-measure in this work. Since we use small dataset to test the effectiveness of the 
proposed method, we test our method on large data by comparing with the existing 
methods in future.   
     To judge the correctness of the text blocks detected, we manually count the Actual 
Text Blocks (ATB) in the frames in the dataset and are considered as a ground truth. 
Since the main objective of the method is to segment text line in video frame, we 
consider each segmentation result given by the method as text block if it contains full 
text information else non-text block. Note that it is not in the line of text line detection 
in video. Based on this view, we define the following.  
Truly Detected text Block (TDB): a detected block that contains text fully. Falsely 
Detected text Block (FDB): a detected block that does not contain text.  The recall, 
precision and f-measures are defined as the following.  
Recall (R) = TDB/ATB, Precision (P) = TDB/(TDB+FDB) and f-measure = 
2RP/(R+P)            
Sample results of the proposed method is shown in Figure 5 where first column 
and third column shows input images, and the second and the fourth column shows 
respective output images given the proposed method. It is observed from the results 
shown in Figure 5 that the proposed method works well for low resolution, complex 
background, different fonts and font sized images. For the image in third row and first 
column, and third row and third column in Figure 5, the proposed method segments 
text properly though the images contain complex background and small fonts. This is 
the advantage of the proposed method compared to the existing methods [20-21] 
where generally the methods fail to segment low contrast, low resolution and small 
font text.  
The quantative results of the proposed method is reported in Table 1 where it is 
noticed that the proposed method gives promising and encouraging results as f-
measure is more than 80% accuracy.

4   Conclusion and Future Work 
In this work, we have proposed new enhancement method by exploring color value in 
different sub-bands. We propose Max-Min clustering method to obtain Max and Min 
clusters to identify the high color value of the pixel. We also use neighbor information 
to enhance the enhanced image further to increase the gap between text and non-text 
pixel based on sliding window operation. We propose new criteria that checks 
whether the components obtained by the k-means clustering and skeleton are fully 
connected component are not. This step helps in eliminating most of the non-text 
components. Further, we introduce new symmetry verification based on stroke width 
distance of the text components to eliminate the non-text components and to obtain 
seed points for each text line. The region growing method is proposed to segment text 
lines by referring Sobel edge map of the enhanced image. The experimental result 
shows the proposed method is good for text segmentation from video frames. It is 
observed from the experimental results that the method gives low accuracy because 
the region growing merges two lines as one line while growing. We are planning to 
modify the region growing to segment text lines of any orientation in future and to 
improve the accuracy. The robustness of the method for handling complex 
backgrounds, different arbitrary orientation will be further investigation as well.
